      <h2>PART I - THE ABBREVIATION OF LEVI'S GENEALOGY</h2>
      <h3 class="chapter">Chapter One</h3>
      <h3>Apparent Contradiction of Words and Numbers</h3>
      <p>
        The words and numbers of certain Hebrew genealogies appear to contradict
        each other when read literally. For example, advanced societies thrived
        across the Near East when the numbers of Shem's genealogy are used to
        determine the date of Noah's Flood. There is no error in Scripture so we
        need to understand the method that the Jewish people used in compiling
        genealogies and read accordingly. With this help we can affirm the
        inerrancy of Biblical statements without denying the overwhelming
        testimony of historical studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, if we understand the OT practice of condensing genealogies,
        we will not unnecessarily give people an excuse to attack the Bible as
        being unreliable. Therefore, such insight is very important. In fact, it
        is so important that we call those methods "the hidden beauty of Hebrew
        genealogies." This hidden beauty focuses on identity in the family line,
        not necessarily the succession from father to son, and sometimes
        includes significant gaps. Such understanding harmonizes those words and
        numbers of the Old Testament often viewed as contradictions and clumsily
        reinterpreted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Executive Summary (pages 5-6) explains the conclusion of this
        book–that Shem's genealogy of Genesis 11 omits 35-55 generations. This
        chapter introduces the first evidence for that conclusion. The
        Levi-Aaron list covers about 500 years which includes the 430-years
        Israel dwelt in Egypt. Yet it contains just four people
        (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron). We are given much information about them,
        even their overlapping life spans which fail to bridge those 500 years.
        The list omits up to a dozen names.
      </p>
      <p>
        This position has not been the view of the church historically. The
        reason has to do with the number of years Israel sojourned in Egypt.
        Whether it was 215 or 430-years has been a continuing controversy for
        2000 years. The preponderance of Scriptural evidence favors 430 but
        historical evidence supported 215. For instance, the Septuagint (i.e.,
        the Greek translation of the Old Testament) says Israel sojourned in
        Canaan <b>and</b> Egypt 430-years. Early authorities like Josephus
        concurred. The church fathers added their "Amen." Because the Hebrew
        text of the key passage, Exodus 12:40, had a problem, it could be
        understood to mean that 430-years was the total time in Canaan and
        Egypt. Events in the lives of Abraham and Jacob were then erroneously
        interpreted to support a 215-year Egyptian sojourn. As a result, the
        Levi-Aaron list was viewed as complete. To this day some still insist
        that Israel only sojourned in Egypt 215-years.
      </p>
      <p>
        While 430-years in Egypt only adds a few years to the antiquity of
        Noah's Flood, an incomplete Levi list opens the door to other Old
        Testament genealogies being incomplete. An abbreviated Shem list could
        push the date for the Flood back hundreds or even thousands of years. To
        find the approximate time of the Flood, Hidden Beauty must address the
        many controversies that have clouded this question. In the process the
        book has become very long.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before proceeding, it must be stated that foundational to this book is
        the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture, the biblical truth that God
        so moved its authors that they wrote His message without error. It
        applies to every word of the original writings. It means that all
        Scripture was originally in harmony with the original writings of all
        other Scripture–that no statement contradicted any other statement in
        its original writing. It also means that all Scripture is important,
        that every word is equally true, that no Scripture should be dismissed,
        overlooked or regarded as insignificant. The church has restated this
        doctrine at critical times in history. Most recently in the Fall of 1978
        an international gathering of nearly 300 noted evangelical scholars
        produced "The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy" which reaffirmed
        this truth in clear but precise terms.
        <sup><a href="#footnotes">1</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Scripture is God's word, it is the final authority on every
        issue it addresses. In this book every effort is made to answer each
        issue solely on the basis of what the Bible itself says. After
        determining what Scripture says, the secular view of where and when
        advanced societies first developed will be discussed because
        surprisingly it supports what the Bible has said all along. Also, by way
        of introduction the following purpose and function of Hebrew genealogies
        must ever be in the minds of those who discuss them.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sectionone">Overview of Hebrew Genealogies</h4>
      <p>
        Most peoples, and especially the West, have used genealogies and
        chronologies to display an unbroken list of immediate relationships such
        as father-son, rulers, priests, etc. In contrast, the basic idea of
        Hebrew genealogies was identity, not succession. Hebrews identified
        descendants with their forefathers and forefathers with their
        descendants. It could be boiled down to this: all descendants were in
        the loins of their forefathers and all forefathers were the fathers of
        their descendants. It was perfectly accurate in Hebrew usage to say B
        was the son of A or to say G was the son of A when actually generations
        B-F came between A and G. For example, Hebrew genealogies could be as
        specific as Adam knew Eve who conceived Cain (Genesis 4:1) or as broad
        as "Jesus Christ, the son of David" (Matthew 1:1). Cain was the
        immediate result of the union of Adam and Eve. There were no
        intermediate generations between the parents and their son. This is the
        narrow use in Hebrew thinking (A begat B). On the other hand, one
        thousand years separated David from his distant son Jesus Christ. This
        is the broad use of genealogies in Scripture (A begat G). The broad use
        could compact many generations into one, yet be perfectly truthful. The
        intentional skipping or omitting of names could be considered condensing
        or abbreviating. It was beautifully efficient and simple. Matthew made
        no error when he wrote "Jesus Christ, the son of David." His purpose was
        to identify Jesus Christ with David genealogically. Authors of Scripture
        determined the degree of completeness of a blood line, often providing
        only as many names as their purpose required. Those in the day of any
        particular author would discern whether his list was complete or not,
        but as time passed this discernment became more difficult. In time, even
        Bible scholars, misunderstanding this broader use of Hebrew genealogies,
        began to wrest the Scripture with their interpretations.
      </p>
      <h4 id="sectiontwo">Condensing a Genealogical List–A Clear OT Example</h4>
      <p>
        A 215-year sojourn by Jacob and his descendants in Egypt is an essential
        element in the historic view that the Flood occurred about 2348 BC
        according to Archbishop James Ussher. His monumental work, Annals of the
        World, first published in Latin in 1650, used the typical approach of
        working back from later known dates to Abraham. This method then added
        the years when each father in Shem's genealogy of Genesis 11 had his
        heir to finally reach the Flood date.
      </p>

      <p>
        A 430-year Egyptian sojourn adds a mere 215-years to this date. But
        recognizing a 430-year Egyptian sojourn introduces a game-changing
        precedent. It means that many names are omitted in Levi's genealogy that
        appears to be complete. Since the Shem list has characteristics similar
        to the Levi-Aaron list, it opens the door to omitted names in that list
        which some vehemently deny.
      </p>

      <p>
        While many have been told that Scripture is confusing about the years
        Israel spent in Egypt, the next chapter will show that no less than God
        Himself witnessed to a 430-year sojourn there. But that is not all.
        Moses likewise witnessed to 430-years in Egypt. Then over a millennium
        later Stephen affirmed God's word and Paul affirmed Moses' word. On the
        other hand, nowhere does Scripture state that Israel sojourned in Egypt
        215-years. Nowhere!
      </p>

      <p>
        Then where did the idea of 215-years in Egypt come from? It was
        primarily from a deduction made from the following words in Exodus and
        Numbers which lists Kohath as a son of Levi, Amram as a son of Kohath
        and Aaron as a son of Amram:
      </p>

      <p class="verse">
        <sup>16</sup>These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their
        generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi
        being 137 years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of Kohath: Amram…, the years of
        the life of Kohath being 133 years. <sup>20</sup>Amram took as his wife
        Jochebed his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses, the
        years of the life of Amram being 137 years. Exodus 6:16, 18, 20.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        <sup>58</sup>These are the clans of Levi: …of Kohath, the clan of the
        Kohathites; …And Kohath was the father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The name
        of Amram's wife was Jochebed the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi
        in Egypt. And she bore to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam their sister.
        Numbers 26:58-59.
      </p>

      <p>
        While the two narratives appear to be a full and complete record of
        descent (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron), the following pages conclusively
        demonstrate that these genealogical records are abbreviated. But the
        historic approach views them as complete which requires rewriting much
        other Scripture. In so doing the cardinal rule of
        interpretation–inerrancy–is violated. This book will apply the broader
        concept of the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies to such
        passages. With this approach those violations of Scripture will be
        eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The passages above report three generations leading to Aaron–that of
        Levi, Kohath and Amram. No one disputes the relationships in these four
        generations, i.e., that Kohath was a direct descendant of Levi, that
        Amram was a direct descendant of Kohath and that Aaron was a direct
        descendant of Amram. When Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Levi was
        about 46 years old so his sons may have been teenagers or even in their
        twenties. All Jacob's male descendants accompanied him to Egypt except
        Joseph and his sons who were already there. Genesis 46:8-26 records that
        list and begins:
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        <sup>8</sup>Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who
        came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons, Reuben, Jacob's firstborn,
        <sup>9</sup>and the sons of Reuben.… <sup>10</sup>The sons of Simeon….
        <sup>11</sup>The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Genesis
        46:8-11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kohath is among the names in the list above. So he was born in Canaan
        before the move to Egypt. The next generation mentioned after Kohath was
        Amram. Exodus says Amram was a son of Kohath. Numbers agrees, saying
        Kohath was the father of Amram. Each passage validates the other. Both
        Exodus and Numbers report that Amram and his wife had children–Exodus
        reports the births of Aaron and Moses while Numbers reveals the names of
        three–Aaron, Moses and Miriam. The 215-year view teaches these four
        generations–Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron–are consecutive, i.e., immediate
        father-son relationships and span the 215-years in Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
        How long of a sojourn in Egypt could they possibly span? Let's
        calculate. Suppose each of these generations dwelling in Egypt fathered
        his named son in the last year of his life. This number would be the
        maximum number of years these four generations could have contributed to
        the total sojourn in Egypt if the genealogies were consecutive without
        any gaps or omissions. Then that number could be viewed in the light of
        a 215 or 430-year sojourn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calculations: Aaron was 83 at the time of the Exodus, so he accounts for
        83 years in Egypt (Exodus 7:7). Levi's grandson, Amram lived 137 years
        (Exodus 6:20), all of them in Egypt. Add: 137 + 83 = 220 years. None of
        Levi's years in Egypt can count since his son Kohath was already alive
        when they moved to Egypt. The only father left to contribute years in
        Egypt is Kohath. How many years did he contribute? Scripture doesn't
        tell his age when they arrived, so for contrast both the maximum and
        minimum years possible will be calculated.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Kohath's minimum age:</em> he was alive when they moved down to
        Egypt and he had a younger brother. If his younger brother had just been
        born, Kohath could have been as young as one year old.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Kohath's maximum age:</em> eleven sons were born to Jacob within a
        nine-year time span at uncle Laban's place. Levi was #3 and Joseph was
        #11. Thus, Levi was born about two years into the nine-year time span
        while Joseph was born last so he was born about seven years later. This
        makes Levi about seven years older than Joseph. Scripture reveals that
        Joseph was 39 when his family joined him in Egypt; Levi would have been
        about 46 (39+7=46). At this time Jacob's sons were starting families
        when they were very young, even younger than 20. If Levi's second son,
        Kohath, was born when his father was just 20, he would have been 26 when
        they moved to Egypt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maximum Range for the age of Kohath:</em> So Kohath could have been
        as young as one or as old as 26 when the family moved to Egypt. If he
        were just one year old, he would contribute the most number of years to
        the Egyptian sojourn. So that number will be found first. Kohath died at
        the age of 133 (Exodus 6:18) so he could have contributed as many as 132
        years to Israel's time in Egypt. Now the numbers are available to
        determine the absolute maximum number of years in Egypt if this
        genealogy (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete. Aaron provides 83
        years. Amram provides another 137 years and Kohath could have provided
        up to 132 years. The total is 352 (83+137+132=352).
      </p>
      <p>
        Three hundred fifty-two years is the maximum number of years these three
        named fathers could contribute towards Israel's total sojourn in Egypt
        if this list is complete. Although, it is most unlikely that a father
        would have had his named heir in the very year he died at such advanced
        ages. For this to happen twice in a row is even more unlikely. As
        already noted, Jacob's sons were starting families as early as the age
        of 20. But for now, the maximum possible number of years in Egypt has
        been found if this genealogy is complete. That total number of years,
        352 years, is more than enough for a 215-year sojourn but it is not
        enough years for a 430-year sojourn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this the 215-year people conclude that when Moses said
        Israel's sojourn was 430-years (Exodus 12:40), he was referring to the
        entire time from Abraham's arrival in Canaan until the Exodus. Scripture
        reports that Abraham, Isaac and Jacob lived in Canaan 215-years before
        the move to Egypt. The remaining 215-years would be the years that are
        left for Israel's sojourn in Egypt. Thus, they say, Israel sojourned in
        Egypt 215, not 430-years.
      </p>
      <p>
        But that interpretation conflicts with the very words of God, Stephen
        and Paul as well as those of Moses, all of whom uphold the 430-year
        number for the years Israel was in Egypt. In effect this approach jumps
        from the frying pan–trying to escape the difficulty of Exodus 6 and
        Numbers 26–into the fire–doing violence to the words of God, Moses,
        Stephen and Paul. If the Exodus and Numbers passages will only support a
        215-year sojourn while the four witnesses testify to a 430-year sojourn,
        the Bible apparently is contradicting itself and inerrancy is
        compromised. Since inerrancy assures that Scripture does not contradict
        itself, how is this dilemma resolved? The answer is found in the hidden
        beauty of Hebrew genealogies
      </p>
      <h4 id="sectionthree">The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</h4>
      <p>
        Because Biblical Hebrew relational terms were used in both narrow and
        broad senses, "father" could mean father, grandfather or ancestor. The
        same was true of son, beget, and other common kinship terms. In Hebrew
        genealogies both the narrow and broad senses of these family
        relationships were employed. In the Levi-Aaron genealogy the maximum
        possible consecutive years of the named four living in Egypt (352) falls
        far short of 430-years in Egypt. To get 430-years more generations are
        needed. Since they are not stated, this genealogy is abbreviated.
        Generations are omitted. The following table shows the impossibility of
        four generations spanning 430-years on the left and therefore what
        missing generations might look like on the right.
      </p>
      <img src="../img/Table-1.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        What actually happened? Amram had a son who had a son and somewhere down
        the line Aaron, Moses and Miriam were born. To say Aaron was the son of
        Amram when many generations came in between is no different than Matthew
        1:1 saying Jesus Christ was the son of David when many generations came
        in between. This was a common and accepted way for ancient Hebrews to
        state their genealogical relationships
      </p>
      <h4 id="ConclusiontotheDebate">Conclusion to the 215/430 Debate</h4>
      <p>
        This chapter began by pointing out that a 215-year Egyptian sojourn is
        not stated in Scripture but is primarily a deduction based on the
        Levi-Aaron genealogy recorded in Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The few
        generations stated in those two passages do not permit a 430-year
        sojourn. While those passages appear to be reporting that a grandson of
        Levi married a daughter of Levi and they became the immediate parents of
        Miriam, Aaron and Moses, that is the overview but there is more to the
        story. Rather Amram and Jochebed had these children through intermediate
        generations. Omitting generations between Amram and Aaron was not a
        scribal error; it was a way to state genealogies efficiently.
      </p>
      <h4 id="Nature-of-the-Levi-Aaron-Abbreviation">
        Nature of the Levi-Aaron Abbreviation
      </h4>
      <p>
        The Jewish people all descended from a common ancestor. The God of
        creation told that ancestor, Abraham, that He would make of him a great
        nation. His grandson, Jacob, had twelve sons. Each formed a unit of the
        promised nation called a tribe. The sons and sometimes further
        descendants of these tribal fathers formed units within each tribe with
        various designations. As populations increased in succeeding generations
        that division was further broken down into a third level. It also had
        various names. Knowing a person's identity with these three levels
        provided a powerful picture of the person. It showed where he belonged
        in the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        God said all booty from the battle of Jericho was under a ban. A soldier
        violated the ban. In judgment God caused the Israelites to lose their
        next battle. When the leaders cried out to God, He said to find the
        guilty soldier and execute him. To find him they were to bring each
        tribe before the LORD. Scripture continues: "And the tribe that the LORD
        takes by lot shall come near by clans. And the clan that the LORD takes
        shall come near by households. And the household that the LORD takes
        shall come near man by man" Joshua 7:14. Here is an instance where God
        Himself spoke of those three levels of organization of the nation–He
        called them tribe, clan and household (ESV). While Scripture uses
        various designations for them in other places, here God used specific
        designations for them. This book will follow His example and refer to
        that first level as tribe, to the second level as clan and to the third
        level as household.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without question Levi, the third son of Jacob, formed a tribe. Numbers
        26 speaks of the second census of Israel. It was conducted just before
        entering Canaan. The tribe of Levi was dedicated to the spiritual life
        of Israel so its population was not counted with the other tribes that
        became the army of Israel. In the census each of the twelve ordinary
        tribes are individually named. In doing so Scripture speaks of each son
        as follows: "Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, the sons of Reuben: of
        Hanoch, the clans of the Hanochites…." Numbers 26:5. The chapter lists
        each of the twelve tribes with the same sons as found in the list that
        went to Egypt 470 years earlier. Then it speaks of the tribe of Levi in
        the same way: "This was the list of the Levites according to their
        clans: of Gershon, the clan of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the clan of
        the Kohathites; of Merari, the clan of the Merarites" (Numbers 26:58).
        Next it says that Kohath was the father of Amram. So, the organization
        of Israel adds to the view that these names are consecutive:
        Levi-Kohath-Amram.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Moses recorded the Levi-Aaron list, he first cited the tribe that
        Aaron belonged to (Levi), then the clan (Kohath) and finally the
        household (Amram). He knew who Aaron's father, grandfather and great
        grandfather were. But they were unknown and unimportant to the nation at
        large. To list them would have been tedious, clumsy and unnecessary. But
        knowing the three levels of Aaron's ancestry was very important. This
        pedigree showed that both Aaron and his younger brother Moses were part
        of the very foundation of the nation. While God called Moses and
        authenticated him with signs, ancestors that laid the foundation of the
        Hebrew people added respect and legitimacy to him as God's chosen
        leader. This understanding of purpose explains why Levi's list is so
        short. Moses omitted all the generations between Amram and Aaron. The
        existence of one undeniably abbreviated Hebrew genealogy in Scripture
        sets a precedent. If one genealogy was abbreviated, others could be as
        well.

        Implications for Shem's Genealogy
      </h4>
      <p>
        While the abbreviation of most Hebrew genealogies would have no
        significant effect on the date of the Flood, an abbreviation in Shem's
        genealogy would. Then, adding those numbers would give an incorrect
        date. But Shem's genealogy contains a feature that makes it different
        from the Levi-Aaron list. It not only identifies each father's son but
        gives the year when that son was born, saying two years after the Flood
        a son by the name of Arpachshad was born to Shem (Genesis 11:10). It
        continues by saying that when Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered
        Shelah (Genesis 11:12). Scripture states the age of each succeeding
        father when his heir was born. This feature appears to assure that
        Shem's list is complete–no ifs, ands or buts. Nevertheless, in view of
        the fact that most inerrancy scholars are certain the Ussher date is too
        late, is there anything in Scripture to suggest the years of any of the
        fathers might be interpreted differently? Does Scripture anywhere
        provide information or give an example that would answer this
        difficulty? In fact it does. The very iron-clad genealogy of Levi
        provides a completely satisfactory solution to the Shem issue in the
        following way. What is overlooked is that the Levi-Aaron list also gives
        factual details about the father before the confirmed omission. While
        some of that information could be true of Aaron's immediate parents,
        other factual details make it impossible for Amram to be the immediate
        father of Aaron. If so, to whom does that factual information apply? It
        must be true of the unnamed immediate son of Amram and only in a broad
        sense is it true of any further omitted generations and of Aaron. The
        following paragraphs identify an amazing list of factual details about
        the generation in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        The father at issue is the third name in the Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron
        genealogy, Amram. The following facts are stated in Scripture about him:
        first, Amram is the first of four named sons born to Kohath (Exodus
        6:18). Remember, Kohath was alive when Jacob joined Joseph to begin the
        sojourn in Egypt. Second, Amram took a wife (Exodus 6:20). Third, her
        name was Jochebed (Exodus 6:20, Numbers 26:59). Fourth, she was the
        daughter of Levi (Numbers 26:59); fifth, she was the sister of Amram's
        father (Exodus 6:20) and, sixth, she was born in Egypt (Numbers 26:59).
        In other words this daughter of Levi was not born in Canaan like Levi's
        three sons–Gershon, Kohath and Merari (Genesis 46:11). Rather, she was
        born after the move, making her younger than her three brothers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seventh, since Amram was not listed among those sons of Jacob that moved
        to Egypt (Genesis 46:11), he, too, was born after the move, that is, he
        too was born in Egypt. If Scripture hadn't included the information
        about Jochebed being born in Egypt, it might have left the impression
        that Amram married someone old enough to be his mother. Eighth, in
        addition to Aaron, Moses was also born to Amram (Exodus 6:20). Ninth, in
        addition to Aaron and Moses, Miriam was also born to Amram and Jochebed
        (Numbers 26:59). Indeed, depending on what is counted, up to nine
        specific facts are revealed in Scripture about the third generation male
        in the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus 6:18-22 and Numbers 26:58-59.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because Hebrews commonly named descendants after famous ancestors, some
        of these facts could apply to the parents of Aaron. But the fact that
        both Amram and Jochebed were born at the beginning of the 430-year
        sojourn in Egypt while Aaron was born near the end of that 430-year
        period separates the third and fourth names in the Levi list by some 300
        years. Three hundred years makes it impossible for Aaron to be the
        immediate son of Amram. Therefore, those nine entirely true factual
        details about Amram apply to his unnamed son and only by the Hebrew
        custom of viewing all descendants as the son of the father do they apply
        to Aaron.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might suggest that numbers are more factual than other information,
        that in the statement "When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg"
        (Genesis 11:16), the number "34" is an absolute fact and cannot be
        viewed in any other way. We agree. The number "34" is an absolute fact.
        It cannot be viewed in any other way. It is just like the absolute fact
        of Jochebed being born in Egypt. Thus, the entire list of nine facts
        about Amram cannot be viewed in any other way. The insight lacking
        through all church history was that Scripture used Hebrew family
        relational terms in both a narrow sense and a broad sense. The question
        here is whether Eber fathering Peleg is used in a narrow sense or broad
        sense. If the writer used it in the broad sense, generations are omitted
        between Eber and Peleg.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Levi-Aaron list becomes the biblical pattern for understanding
        details of a father before a suspected omission. The details apply to
        the first unnamed son while the name that appears is used in the broad
        sense of a son further down the line. For beyond doubt names are missing
        between Amram and Aaron because Aaron came some 300 years after Amram.
        To remove that impossible timespan previous generations argued fiercely
        for a 215-year sojourn in Egypt. Since some creationists still hold that
        view, the entire next chapter explains the impossibility of that
        position.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the biblical pattern is applied to Shem's list, if there are one or
        more omissions, the age of the father when his heir was born refers
        specifically to the first unnamed generation. But a high degree of
        certainty is needed to suspect names are omitted from any list. Shem's
        list gives two. First is the impossibly late Flood date it produces
        apart from omitted names. But chapter seven gives an overwhelming second
        reason. While longevity decreased between two and eight years per
        generation after the Flood, the decrease between Eber and Peleg is 225
        years or 61% of the entire decrease from the Flood until human longevity
        stabilized at 70 years for a full lifetime. The Eber-Peleg record is
        another Amram-Aaron case.
      </p>
      <h4 id="Viewing-Shems-List-as-a-Chrono-Genealogy">
        Viewing Shem's List as a Chrono-Genealogy
      </h4>
      <p>
        Those holding that Shem's list is complete add the ages of the fathers
        when their sons were fathered and declare that those years make it
        possible to determine the date of the Flood. They call that type of
        genealogy a chrono-genealogy. They then reason that even if there are
        omitted names between Eber and Peleg the number 34 ties Peleg to a
        chronology and therefore the total time between Eber and Peleg cannot
        exceed 34 years. This argument is also called the "bookends" argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet, how is a number different from any other category of words that
        express an absolutely true detail, such as the detail that Jochebed was
        the sister of Amram's father who lived at the beginning of the 430-year
        sojourn in Egypt? Clearly there is no difference. Numbers are no
        different from other precise words expressing a fact. Words that express
        true facts are true whether they are numbers or not. The bookend
        argument makes a superficial distinction between numbers and other words
        and interjects a false element into the time of the Flood debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        While that argument is clever, it is incorrect and must be recognized as
        an invention of man to support a particular interpretation of how to
        treat those numbers. It is not stated by Scripture and violates how
        Scripture itself treats such details in Levi's genealogy. Further it is
        not verified by Moses in as much as he did not add up those numbers in
        Shem's list. Most important of all this argument could not be why God
        included those numbers because they give the wrong answer for the time
        of the Flood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who hold this view reason: "Why else would Eber's age be given
        when he fathered Peleg other than to tell when the Flood happened?" In
        response Andrew E. Steinmann answered this question (applying it to
        Genesis 5 as well as Genesis 11 since the two instances of this format
        actually provide a stronger case against viewing them as having a
        chronological purpose):
      </p>
      <p class="quote">
        This [chrono-genealogical argument] assumes that the information was
        included for chronological purposes and then argues that the genealogies
        must therefore be useful for chronological calculations. In fact, the
        author does not state the reason for including this information…. This
        information could well have illustrated several points without being
        intended to be used in chronological calculations relating to the events
        of the narrative. For instance, the information may simply have been
        intended to demonstrate: 1. The different environmental and societal
        conditions that prevailed in that era. People not only lived longer in
        Genesis 5, they matured more slowly and/or married at a later age. 2.
        That conditions had changed in Genesis 11 and people came to marry and
        have children at a younger age, and they lived shorter lives. 3. That
        the persons in genealogies were actual historical persons, not fictions
        or fictionalized historical persons. These points could be illustrated
        with selective genealogies that do not include every generation. The
        information would not be superfluous, but it also would not be useful
        for the purpose of chronological calculations.<sup

        In fact, the merits of the chrono-genealogical argument are not strong
        in the eyes of most Bible scholars. Moses wrote around 1400 BC when the
        lifespan of man was 70. Saying that people once lived to the age of 900
        would be met with skepticism. Moses knew about the well-known fictitious
        stories of exceptionally long lifespans in the past. The Sumerian King
        List included one king who was said to have reigned 43,200 years. Moses'
        numbers had to be separated from such exaggerations. By giving the years
        before the birth of the heir, the years after and the total years of
        each father in Genesis 5, God through Moses did all He could to assure
        His readers those people actually lived that long. Furthermore, those
        numbers provide the very patterns that have aided us in building our
        explanations concerning man's decreasing longevity which is the key
        argument for the missing 35-55 generations between Eber and Peleg.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the Abstract of Steinmann's 2018 article, he noted a recent spate of
        articles arguing that the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 were complete,
        skipping no generations. In checking his observation this author found
        that three of the articles in a single issue of a popular monthly
        age-of-the-earth magazine mentioned the too-recent year number.
        Steinmann summarized his article as follows:
        <b>"The major arguments they use are defective and falsifiable."</b>
        <sup><a href="#footnotes">3</a></sup> His version is 18 pages. But he
        only scratches the surface. Somewhere a book must spell it all out in
        detail. Hopefully by showing the nature and function of ancient Hebrew
        genealogies Hidden Beauty will open people's eyes to the frequent
        abbreviating of biblical genealogies.

        The Abbreviation of Shem's Genealogy in Retrospect
      </h4>
      <p>
        Human longevity declined gradually from the first fathers born after the
        Flood until the days of Moses, from average full lifespans of 450 years
        to average full lifespans of 70 years. This is an average full lifespan
        decline of 380 years. Scripture gives abundant details to track this
        decline. Shelah who represents the second generation born after the
        Flood (433-year lifespan), lived five fewer years than his father
        (438-year lifespan) who was born two years after the Flood. Over the
        next two millennia the rate of decline was sometimes faster and
        sometimes slower but longevity stopped declining in Moses' day when he
        wrote that a full lifetime was 70 years. To this day 70 years generally
        stands as a full lifespan. But there was one exception during the
        gradual decline of those born after the Flood, a sudden one-time drop of
        225 years. This one instance is between Eber and Peleg. Eber lived 464
        years while Peleg, the next named person, lived 239 years, a decline of
        225 years or 61% (225/369=61%) of the total decline of human longevity
        after the Flood. This eye-popping decline was either produced by another
        catastrophe as great as the Flood or it is another Amram-Aaron case.
        There is no evidence for such a catastrophe 100 years after the Flood.
        Thus, it is another Amram-Aaron case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Amram-Aaron sequence leaves out an estimated 8-12 generations. The
        Eber-Peleg sequence leaves out as many as 55 generations. With new
        generations starting each 30-34 years when people lived 200-450 years,
        this represents up to 1900 more years of human history after the Flood
        than previously thought (and pushes the first man back accordingly).
        Since God is not more specific, we dare not violate this ambiguity.
        These few additional years make no difference at all in the
        creation-evolution controversy, but they make a world of difference in
        honoring Scripture because they treat both the words and numbers of
        Scripture as inerrant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once we understand what the Bible literally says, we are free to examine
        the findings of secular disciplines; for, sooner or later when the
        secular world has all the facts, it will confirm God's record. So, have
        such findings caught up with the revelation of Scripture? The Flood
        changed the face of the earth up to ten miles down so it obliterated the
        physical evidence of human existence that would speak to the condensing
        of the Genesis 5 list. However, the Genesis 11 list involves the history
        of man after the Flood. To some extent evidence for that history still
        exists and is constantly being discovered through such disciplines as
        studies of Hebrew and related languages, textual studies, archaeology
        and ancient Near East history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adding the time represented in the missing generations between Eber and
        Peleg to the additional 215-years in Egypt provides enough time to
        encompass all well-established human history as found in written records
        since the Flood. Thus, getting the genealogies of Scripture right
        provides harmony between the words and numbers of Scripture and removes
        a huge stumbling block between biblical creationists and other
        Evangelical scholars. (See chapter seven for a full development of the
        abbreviation of Shem's genealogy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The next chapter examines the words of four witnesses to a 430-year
        sojourn in Egypt. In Archbishop Ussher's day the text of Exodus 12:40
        was deficient; so, for centuries believers held the 215-year view
        believing they were standing on Scripture. Over the next two centuries
        the text was clarified. Now eminent Hebrew scholars are unanimous–Moses
        clearly says the Egyptian sojourn lasted 430-years. But all along the
        words of God Himself to Abraham in Genesis 15:13 pointed to a 430-year
        sojourn in Egypt and excluded a 215-year sojourn. <br /><br />
