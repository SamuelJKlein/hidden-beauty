    <strong>Evidence from the Times of Job for Missing Generations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Chapter nine showed that when Job's 280-year lifespan is placed on the
    timeline of human longevity decay, Shem's genealogy clearly omits
    generations. The next chapter found that the very purpose of the book,
    exposing the supreme enemy of man's soul argues convincingly for missing
    generations. Now a third argument from the book of Job, equally powerful,
    fills chapter 11-- constant references to unusual weather conditions. Such
    weather uniquely characterizes an ice age. The events of Job are played
    against the backdrop of the Great Ice Age and reflect a setting long before
    Solomon and even Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    Henry Morris observed that Job mentioned cold more than any other book in
    the Bible. He went out on a limb to write "there are even hints of the
post-flood Ice Age scattered throughout the Book of Job."    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> The
    struggle for survival in an ice age world filled the memories of all who
    spoke in Job. Job himself personally experienced at least the tail end of
    the Great Ice Age in the first 140 years of his life. This provides the
    strongest of the three arguments found in chapters 9-11 for generations
    being omitted between Eber and Peleg since the Patriarchs lived long after
    the Ice Age. But as previously discussed expositors place Job's years
    anywhere from the days of the Patriarchs to the days of David (2100-1000
    BC).

        Discovering Dr. Bernard E. Northrup
        <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
            <sup><strong><sup>[2]</sup></strong></sup>

</p>
<p>
    After many years of growing conviction that generations are omitted from
    Shem's list, I stumbled across Dr. Bernard E. Northrup who excitedly taught
    that the Book of Job graphically portrayed life in the Great Ice Age. He
    had been doing this since 1971 but creationists mostly ignored him because
    of the two catastrophes he saw striking planet earth in Genesis 1:2-8.
    Nevertheless, Northrup was unique in that he was a professional in three
    areas-geology, the Old Testament and linguistics. Most importantly, he held
    to the inerrancy of the Bible. As to geology he loved rocks from childhood
    and prepared for a career as a geologist. Then came the call of God and he
    became a Hebrew professor instead, teaching seminary level Hebrew, Greek
    and Aramaic for a lifetime. His unique background led to unparalleled
    insight into the subject of Hidden Beauty.
</p>
<p>
    Over the years he served his denomination's mission board by helping Bible
    translators often located in remote areas typically accessed by missionary
    aircraft. Geology was always in the back of his mind because to him it
    confirmed the Bible and showed beyond question the reality of the God he
    loved. Whenever possible he would work with the pilot to plot a course that
    took him by a significant geological formation. For nearly half a century
    he collected information on hundreds of formations his gifted eyes
    observed, invariably associating them the great biblical event that
    produced them. In the church this author attended was a retired missionary
    who told of arranging for Northrup to see a formation in northeastern
    Brazil.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup correctly felt that God's Word and God's works would agree. By
    that he meant the Bible and the geological column would agree. He felt that
    God's creating an earth covered with water on Day One of creation week and
    thrusting up the super continent out of the water to begin Day Three would
    have produced a considerable portion of the geologic column. This is the
    portion that lacks fossils. Then the Flood contributed its share to the
    geological column and the breakup of the super continent added further
    features to the geological column, according to Northrup. Last of all and
    maybe on the back of the super continent break up, the Great Ice Age would
    have completed the geological column.
</p>
<p>
    In Northrup's early years (1950-1975) he adamantly opposed those who
    assigned most or even the entire geologic column to Noah's Flood. In one
    article he welcomed the ideas of a promising young geologist, Dr. Steven A.
    Austin, feeling those ideas were headed in the right direction. Austin's
    doctoral dissertation spoke of coal fields in New York and Pennsylvania
    grading from harder coal in the east to softer coal in the west. In
    Northrup's opinion the action of the biblical Flood explained how this
    happened.

</p>
<p>
    Northrup's views reached maturity about the middle of his career when it
    came to him that Job was an ice age book. No previous Old Testament scholar
    had drawn such a conclusion. Why could he? The explanation lies in the fact
    that the science behind an ice age was brand new. It began to develop
    during his lifetime and continues to grow to this day. His training and his
    continuing interest in geology plus his highly developed skills in biblical
    Hebrew made him the man of the hour. To this day some 50 years after his
    1971 epiphany few expositors acknowledge the many ice age statements in the
    book. To help the reader see this aspect of the book of Job, Northrup's ice
    age observations are drawn into the list below:
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
    <li>
        Seas frozen over ("the broad waters are frozen fast" 37:10; "the waters
        become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen" 38:30);
    </li>
    <li>
        Clouds loaded with moisture ("He loads the thick cloud with moisture"
        37:11);
    </li>
    <li>
        Ice swollen flash floods ("My brothers are treacherous...as torrential
        streams...dark with ice" 6:15-16);
    </li>
    <li>
        Volcanism/pyroclastic flows ("fire of God fell from heaven" 1:16;
        "underneath it is turned up as by fire" 28:5);
    </li>
    <li>
        Sun and stars hidden by the thick clouds of hypercyclones and possibly
        dense clouds of ash from volcanic eruptions ("who commands the sun, and
        it does not rise" 9:7; "Deep darkness...thick clouds" 22:13-14);
    </li>
    <li>
        Glaciers ("From whose womb did the ice come forth?" 38:29);
    </li>
    <li>
        Canyon-cutting erosion ("who has cleft a channel for the torrents of
        rain?" 38:25);
    </li>
    <li>
        Extreme earthquakes ([he] "shakes the earth out of its place, and its
        pillars tremble" 9:6);
    </li>
    <li>
        Crustal upheaval ("he removes...overturns the mountains" 9:5);
    </li>
    <li>
        Destructive winds ("a great wind struck the four corners of the house,
        and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead" 1:19);
    </li>
    <li>
        Violent lightning storms ("He lets go...His lightning to the corners of
        the earth" 37:3);
    </li>
    <li>
        Intense rainfall ("His mighty downpour [forces] every man [indoors]"
        37:6-7);
    </li>
    <li>
        Snow and hail storms great enough to interrupt wars ("Have you entered
        the storehouses of the snow or...hail?" 38:22-23);
    </li>
    <li>
        Hunger and inadequate shelter ("want and hard hunger...dwell in
        holes...and rocks" 30:3, 6);
    </li>
    <li>
        Tsunamis ("If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them
        out, they overwhelm the land" 12:15).
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    <strong>Significance of the Above List</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Through the centuries no one associated these acts of nature with an ice
    age because the science behind an ice age was not understood. Even today
    the cause of the many ice ages embraced by secular science is hotly
    debated. An ice age requires two opposite conditions-heat and cold. The
    heat is necessary to evaporate vast quantities of water from the ocean
    which fall as record amounts of rainfall at the lower latitudes and as
    sleet and snow at the upper latitudes. The friction of earth movements that
    are evidenced by powerful earthquakes, by the horizontal and vertical
    movement of crustal plates and by extensive volcanic activity combine to
    produce the heat. All of these acts of nature are found in Job.
</p>
<p>
    Atmospheric volcanic ash accounts for the cold. One Indonesian volcano,
    Mount Tambora, erupted throughout 1815 and 1816. Its ash blanketed the
    earth sufficiently to cause worldwide harvest failures in 1816, an event
    known as the year without a summer. Behind this phenomenon is the physics
    of wave lengths. A thin layer of ash high in the sky does not impede light
    rays. Even in the presence of such a layer the sun by day and the moon and
    stars by night can be seen. But heat has a different wave length. This
    difference decreases its ability to pass through even a thin layer of ash.
    Depending on the amount of ash in the sky, a portion of the sun's heat rays
    are reflected back into space.
</p>
<p>
    To bring on an ice age volcanoes need to release enough volcanic ash to
    drop summer temperatures by up to 40 degrees. Further, this condition must
    last for centuries. The multiplication of and eventual extinction of Wooley
    Mammoths along the Arctic shoreline reveals this happened. Only Noah's
    flood could cause these two extreme conditions. Since there was only one
    such flood that covered the highest mountains, there was only one ice age.
</p>
<p>
    Creation scientists have advanced various models for the Biblical Flood.
    One, the Catastrophic Tectonic Plate theory, produces ample earth movements
    to produce the necessary heat. First, the entire pre-Flood ocean floor
    subducted under the great continent. Second, a 45,000-mile trench formed on
    the ocean floor, allowing magma to rise from deep in the earth and replace
    the old ocean floor. Third, heat from the magma and the friction of rock
    sliding on rock warmed the world's oceans by 40 to 50 degrees. Fourth, vast
    worldwide volcanic activity continued for the next thousand years. Fifth,
    the heated oceans evaporated enormous quantities of water to produce the
    Ice Age. Sixth, the one great continent broke up into the many continents
    and islands of today.
</p>
<p>
    Regardless of the model, continuous ash in the sky and massive evaporation
    from the world's oceans caused the Ice Age. By Job's day the earth was
    settling down and the Ice Age was coming to an end, but the extreme
    conditions it produced were still vividly in the collective memory of all
    who spoke and are found frequently in their dialog.
</p>
<p>
    Job hardly begins when these extremes appear. In his back yard, so to
    speak, a volcanic pyroclastic flow consumed his 7000 sheep and their
    keepers (Job 1:16). His servant described the event as "the fire of God."
    While it may have been a lightning storm ranging over many square miles of
    land which would be remarkable in itself, other acts of nature in the book
    point to a volcano spewing hot gasses down its side and across Job's
    grazing land. Volcanoes are the result of earth movements and unheard-of
    earth movements were still common in Job's day. Both earth movements far
    beyond anything experienced today and the earthquakes of enormous magnitude
    that they produced are casually mentioned:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>5</sup>
        He who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them
        in his anger, <sup>6</sup>who shakes the earth out of its place, and
        its pillars tremble. Job 9:5-6.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Just three verses after the fire of God, a violent storm with unheard of
    wind speeds struck. This mega-tornado collapsed his oldest son's house,
    fell on its occupants and killed hundreds. He lived in a house, not the
    tent of a nomad. For the sake of coolness houses in hot, dry lands were
    constructed with heavy building materials like stone or brick. Lost were
    Job's seven sons, three daughters, family members, guests, friends, and all
    the servants but one.
</p>
<p>
    In Job are more references to ice age type weather than any other book of
    the Bible. During the Great Ice Age, while snow fell at the upper
    latitudes, rain fell closer to the equator on land that later became
    deserts. Both statements in the book of Job and modern science reveal this.
    The following pages cite numerous indications of such weather conditions:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>15</sup>
        My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams
        that pass away, <sup>16</sup>which are dark with ice, and where the
        snow hides itself. <sup>17</sup>When they melt, they disappear, when it
        is hot, they vanish from their place. Job 6:15-17
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    These verses depict weather extremes-large quantities of ice and snow
    accumulating in stream beds during the winter period, then becoming
    treacherous as the summer hot weather melted them in areas that today are
    semi-deserts.
</p>
<p>
    Those of Job's day observed how such rushing water produced erosion which
    he used to illustrate how his suffering was wearing away his faith:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The waters wear away the stones, the torrents wash away the soil of the
        earth; [even] so you destroy the hope of man. Job 19:14.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Like ice and cold, excessive water is mentioned frequently in Job. Eliphaz
    eulogizes God's provision of water: "he gives rain on the earth and sends
    waters on the fields" (Job 5:10). Job spoke of washing himself with snow
    (Job 9:30) and of waiting for the spring rain (Job 29:23). "They [the poor]
    are wet with the rain of the mountains" (Job 24:8). "Drought and heat
    snatch away the snow waters" (Job 24:19). "In the gullies of the torrents
    they [the poor] must dwell" (Job 30:6). "The wind...the roar of the storm"
    (Job 30:22). Job, Elihu and even God Himself dwelt on violent storms, snow,
    ice, thick clouds and the rain they produced, none of which are common
    events in NW Arabia today or even when Abraham lived.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>8</sup>
        He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split
        open under them. <sup>14</sup>The thunder of his power, who can
        understand? (Selected statements of Job in 6:8-14.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>6</sup>
        For to the snow he [God] says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the
        downpour, his mighty downpour. <sup>10</sup>By the breath of God ice is
        given, and the broad waters are frozen fast. <sup>11</sup>He loads the
        thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning. (Selected
        statements of Elihu in Job 37:6-11.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>22</sup>
        Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the
        storehouses of the hail? <sup>25</sup>Who has cleft a channel for the
        torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt, <sup>26</sup>to bring
rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man,        <sup>27</sup>to satisfy the waste and desolate land and to make the
        ground sprout with grass? <sup>28</sup>Has the rain a father or who has
        begotten the drops of dew? <sup>29</sup>From whose womb did the ice
come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven?        <sup>30</sup>The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the
        deep is frozen. <sup>34</sup>Can you lift up your voice to the clouds,
        that a flood of waters may cover you? <sup>35</sup>Can you send forth
        lightnings&#8230;. <sup>37</sup>Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or
        who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens, <sup>38</sup>when the dust
        runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together? (Selected
        statements of God in Job 38.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Elihu spoke of lakes frozen fast (Job 37:10) while God spoke of seas being
    frozen: "waters become hard like stone and the face of the deep is frozen"
    (Job 38:30). These words describe ice age events. Deserts are notorious for
    heat and cold. But cold nights don't freeze lakes like stone or cover seas
    with ice. Job may have learned of frozen oceans from travelers since
    caravan drivers heard many tales. But Elihu was most likely speaking about
    lakes freezing solid right where these five men lived-in an area from
    central Mesopotamia to central Jordan. Such extensive freezing could only
    occur before the Ice Age ended.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Growing Desertification</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The book of Job speaks at length of large-scale farming and ranching on the
    one hand and desert-like conditions on the other. It would seem that they
    don't go together, but the fact remains that a careful examination of many
    statements suggests there was a cold, wet season and a hot, dry one and
    that both were extreme where Job lived. The wet season brought some
    violently moist weather while the dry season was very hot. This would have
    occurred in the final stages of the Ice Age.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Rifts and Tidal Waves</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Geologists know of another earth movement that happened late in all this
    activity. A crack developed in the crust of the Afro-Eurasian continent,
    from Turkey all the way to Tanzania, 6000 miles to the south. It is called
    the Syro-African Rift. Northrup carefully investigated the Jordan Rift
    segment where a lake formed from north of the Sea of Galilee to south of
    the Dead Sea. Geologists call this ancient body of water Lake Lisan. Ice
    age storms may have filled Lake Lisan to the point where it connected with
    the Red Sea but movements changed that topography again and again so no one
    can tell for sure. But if so, the surface of the lake would have been over
    a quarter of a mile higher than the present elevation of the Dead Sea.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup graphically captures the reader's imagination by saying that Job
    12:15 (point #15 above) poetically describes the action of a tsunami/tidal
    wave. First the water recedes due to an earthquake somewhere at sea, but
    then returns with great destructive force. Northrup found plains high above
    the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea that were washed repeatedly by tsunamis
    all the way to the mountains in Jordan. He also found walls high on either
    side of the Jordan Rift that were pounded by wave action. If Job lived at
    that time, he could have been an eye witness to these tidal waves and
    Leviathans that made their way up the trench from the Red Sea. All of this
    action left a fertile valley. Half a millennium later when most of the
    water had evaporated Scripture described the southern portion of this
    valley which attracted Lot along with the substantial population of Sodom
    and Gomorrah:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        And Lot lifted up his eyes and saw that the Jordan Valley was well
        watered everywhere like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt,
        in the direction of Zoar. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and
        Gomorrah.) Genesis 13:10.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    If the Great Ice Age is so obvious in the Book of Job, why didn't students
    of the book point this out long ago? As previously pointed out, first and
    foremost, the science of an ice age only began to be hammered out during
    the 20<sup>th</sup> century and its fine points are still being debated so
    the associated phenomena were not realized in the past. Consequently, Bible
    expositors through the ages would have been ignorant of the weather
    phenomena associated with an ice age and translated those Hebrew
    expressions within the range of their non-ice age knowledge. Second, some
    of the references identified by Northrup could be explained in other ways!
    For example, Job 9:17: "He crushes me with a tempest" is figurative. As a
    satisfying explanation for the verse, the expositor would leave it at that.
    But behind Job's metaphor would be the literal kind of violent storm he
    experienced during the Great Ice Age that took people's lives. Third, there
    was only one ice age so at only one time in all Bible history would such
    phenomena actually be witnessed by people and described.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe even more astonishing is the fact that Northrup had been teaching Job
    for nearly 20 years when this insight suddenly came to him. Imagine-a
    scholar in the Hebrew who was also an avid professional geologist did not
    see those clear references to an ice age for that many years. This suggests
    how difficult it is for mankind to recognize obvious truths in God's Word
    when their minds have not been conditioned to such insights. Maybe this
    explains why twenty centuries of Christian scholarship has not recognize
    the obvious omission of names between Eber and Peleg.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hypercyclones and Rainfall in Job</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Book of Job speaks often of fierce rain storms. To have such heavy
    rainfall there must be thick clouds. Eliphaz speaks of clouds so thick that
    Job might think God cannot see what he does: "But you say, 'What does God
    know? Can he judge through the deep darkness? Thick clouds veil him, so
    that he does not see'" (Job 22:13-14). Later Elihu says, "He loads the
    clouds with thick moisture" (Job 37:10). In fact, Elihu spent all of Job 37
    speaking of extreme weather and most of it has to do with rain. He stated
    that God orders "the downpour, his mighty downpour" to fall and it drives
    both man and beast to shelter (Job 37:6-8).
</p>
<p>
    God Himself asked Job:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>25</sup>
        Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>and a way for the thunderbolt,</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>26</sup>to bring rain on a land where no man is,</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>on the desert in which there is no man,</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>27</sup>to satisfy the waste and desolate land</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>and to make the ground sprout with grass? Job 38:25-27.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here God speaks of the erosion caused by intense rainfall. He even says He
    causes rain to fall on the desert and that it sprouts with grass. Just how
    frequently this would have happened in Job's day is explained by
    meteorologist Dr. Larry Vardiman whose specialty is hurricanes. He and an
    associate modeled a hypothetical tropical cyclone in the Arabian Sea
    (Persian Gulf), raising the sea surface temperature to 95<sup>o</sup>F
    which would have happened frequently in the warmer latitudes during the Ice
    Age.
</p>
<p>
    The model produced what he called a hypercyclone. It was 3000 miles in
    diameter and stretched from the Western Mediterranean through the Middle
    East. Lasting 18 days it produced 15 inches of rain on current desert
    regions that now may not see rain in a decade. Over Pakistan it dropped 300
    inches of rain. Vardiman concluded that due to Ice Age storms permanent
    vegetation would have covered much of what is now desert in Africa and the
Middle East for 1000 years.    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><sup><sup>[4]</sup></sup></a>
    Separately, space imaging of the Sahara Desert shows depressions that were
    once lakes and archaeological exploration has found recent remains of
    aquatic creatures in those desert formations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Meaning of Peleg's Name</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In his later writings Northrup adamantly taught that Peleg's name meant
    more than "divided." He insisted that it included the agent of the
    division-water; "Peleg," he said, meant "divided by water." He supported
    his view from geology and chronology, but the underlying Hebrew was his
    major argument. Here is the gist of it:
</p>
<p>
    Most ancient Hebrew words are built on roots of three consonants which form
    a verb. Not until the work of the Masoretic scribes between 500 and 800 AD
    were the unwritten vowels sounds and breathing marks added to the text.
    Peleg's name is built on the root verb PLG which broadly is translated "to
    split, to divide." Strong's Concordance lists 17 occurrences of the noun
    built on this very root found in the Old Testament. Seven times the noun is
    used as a proper name and is always translated as the name "Peleg" in the
    English. The other ten times the noun refers to a stream, brook, river or
    channel and is translated as such. Strong assigned the word number 6378 to
    the noun when it is used in a general way for a flowing stream of water
    (Isaiah 32:2, Job 29:6, Psalm 1:3; 119:136, Proverbs 5:16, Proverbs 21:1,
    Lamentations 3:48, Isaiah 30:25, Psalm 65:9 and Psalm 46:4) and 6379 when
    it refers to the son of Eber.
</p>
<p>
    To cite just one of these ten verses, familiar Psalm 1:3 says "He (the man
    who delights in the law of the LORD) is like a tree planted by streams of
    water." The noun "streams" is the noun form from the root PLG. Since it is
    possessive plural, the form is PALGE. How did the Hebrews associate a
    river, stream or canal with the concept of dividing? Depending on the size
    of those flows, they more or less divide or separate people on one side
    from people on the other. Here now is a most remarkable use of the noun.
    The very form of Peleg's name, the masculine nominative singular form, is
    found in Psalm 65:9 which reads "The river of God is full of water."
    "River" in this verse is PELEG, the same form as the personal noun for a
    son of Eber, PELEG.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, the three-consonant root PLG has an even more basic root, the
    primary two-consonant PL collection of words. Besides PLG eight other PL
    verbs are found in the ancient Hebrew. All in some way are associated with
    "divide." For instance, one, PLT, means "to escape." One might wonder what
    that has to do with "divide." If the prisoner escapes, he is divided from
    his prison and captors. Another, PLL, means "to intervene." When someone or
    something intervenes the previous condition is split or divided.
    Consequently, the choice of the three consonant PLG within this group for a
    name speaks not only of a division but implies a division somehow
    associated with water.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup compared the Hebrew with other languages. First, he looked at
    other Semitic languages and then at non-Semitic languages. He wrote, "In
    the related Semitic languages, Arabic and Ethiopic, the root PLG means
'river.' In Arabic the root is modified to PHALAG."    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup><sup>[5]</sup></sup></a> In
    searching Classical Greek he found no less than 18 different nouns bearing
    the same foundation (PLG) and all referred to the sea in some way. He
    observed that even in English this letter sequence is found in such words
as archi<strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>a<strong><u>g</u></strong>o, <strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>a<strong><u>g</u></strong>ic depths and<strong><u>p</u></strong>e<strong><u>l</u></strong>i    <strong><u>c</u></strong>an which is from an associated root, PLK, and
refers to the bill of the pelican that divides the water to catch his prey.    <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup><sup>[6]</sup></sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    In his paper on the rock record he gives the following translation of the
verse which tells why Peleg was given his name:    <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup><sup>[7]</sup></sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        And unto Eber were born two sons. The name of the first was Peleg
    </strong>
["divided by water"]<strong>, for in his days the earth was divided </strong>[by water]    <strong>. </strong><strong>(Brackets by Northrup.) Genesis 10:25. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In this reference he explained the meaning of Peleg as follows: "Both the
    name 'Peleg' and the word 'divided' are built upon the Hebrew root that
    consistently is used of water division. This is true both in Hebrew and in
    Classical Greek. In the latter there are about 18 nouns based on this root
    and each one has much to do with the ocean." Northrup then took certain
    creationists to task with, "Some creationists have made the terrible
    mistake of jumping to the conclusion that this verse [Genesis 10:25] refers
    to the division of the languages at Babel, an event that is described when
    chapter eleven [of Genesis] fills in important details that were only
    referred to in chapter ten. The researcher should note that this is a
    common approach in the Hebrew language." The confusion comes because
    Scripture speaks of both a division of mankind into languages (Genesis 10:5
    and 10:32-which employs an entirely different Hebrew verb root, "to
    spread") and a division of the land surfaces of the earth by water (Genesis
    10:25-the PLG verb root, "to divide").
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, Genesis 10:25 contains the three Hebrew consonants (PLG)
    twice, first as a proper name and then as a verb. In both cases Northrup
    placed brackets after the Hebrew word to show his understanding of its
    relationship to water. In the first instance he defined the Hebrew noun
    used for a person's name as Peleg or "divided by water" and in the second
    instance he defined the Hebrew verb PALAG as "divided by water." Thus,
Northrup wrote time and again, "Peleg was named 'divided by water.'"    <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><sup><sup>[8]</sup></sup></a> In
    another paper he wrote, "This ["divided by water"] is the major meaning of
    the word Peleg, surprisingly borne out in cognate and non-cognate
languages."    <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup><sup>[9]</sup></sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    More recently Dr. John Morris and Dr. James Johnson wrote a paper in which
    they agreed with Northrup to a point. Like Northrup they felt the division
    of Genesis 10:25 was geological and geographical, not linguistic. They
    spoke of Northrup's work at length. While Northrup felt this division by
    water occurred when the great single continent was broken up, they felt it
    was accomplished when the ice from the Great Ice Age melted and separated
the continents by water.    <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup><sup>[10]</sup></sup></a>
    Other creationists have also tagged Peleg's name as marking the end of the
    Ice Age when the melting ice sheets raised sea level 400 feet and covered
    the land bridges which had connected continents thus dividing the earth by
    water. That explanation seems a better fit for the meaning of Peleg's name
    ("to divide by water") and the time in which he lived-39-59 generations
    after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup's explanation required more years between the Flood and Job's
    ordeal than the Masoretic Text allowed. So he turned to the Septuagint
    chronology. In the LXX he calculated that 531 years elapse from the Flood
    to the birth of Peleg which together with the additional time in Egypt less
    Ussher's early date for Solomon's temple supplied 645 years of breathing
    room. That would be an ice age in record time but it would have to do. The
    Ussher followers cram the Great Ice Age into even fewer years which
    possibly compromises their science in order to preserve their
    interpretation of Shem's genealogy as complete. It would seem that the
    Masoretic Text numbers together with the hidden beauty of Hebrew
    genealogies give a better explanation for the missing years, especially
    since there are far more than 645 missing years.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup served on the faculties of Bible colleges and seminaries from 1953
    to 2005 and addressed these issues for nearly 50 years. He died in 2008.
    During his years he made important contributions to the thinking of those
    who have attempted to harmonize what God said in His Word with what He did
    to the surface of the earth. Northrup declared these ideas in lecture after
    lecture and wrote them in articles but not in any permanent book. A
    decreasing number of web sites contain these articles. Since he expressed
    ideas that are contrary to current thinking, even his sound ideas may
    eventually be lost to the body of Christ. Nevertheless, Northrup would be
    pleased to know that most creationists have come to recognize both
    centuries of major geologic activity after the Flood and much geologic
    activity before the Flood as well.
</p>
<p>
    Now you can see why I was so delighted to discover Dr. Bernard E. Northrup.
    While I was certain that Job lived long before the Patriarchs, Northrup
    with his ice age observations in Job provided a powerful argument for Job
    living long before them. His observations on geology and the Ice Age
    require the many generations that are omitted between Eber and Peleg.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Restatement of the Ice Age Argument</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our case that Job lived during the Great Ice Age remains so novel to many
    it bears a second look. While Job, his friends and even God made numerous
    references to an ice age, no commentator in the past knew what they meant.
Why? Ice age knowledge is a new discovery in science. Only in the 20    <sup>th</sup> century did scientists begin to develop an understanding of
    the subject. Even today it has more questions than answers. What then of
    the numerous ice age conditions found in Job's pages? Ignored,
    spiritualized, disregarded! Consequently, believing Shem's chronology was
    complete, commentators for the last 2000 years placed Job between Abraham
    and David, 500-1500 years too late.
</p>
<p>
    Secular science has developed over 60 models for an ice age. There are so
    many because none work. They will be surprised when they finally realize
    that two opposite conditions are needed for an ice age, much heat and much
    cold, which Noah's Flood provided abundantly. Creation scientists realized
    this truth as they studied the Flood. The Flood pumped heat into the
    world's oceans when "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth." That
    heat evaporated enormous amounts of water which fell as snow and eventually
    produced two-mile thick ice sheets. Then the cold kept the summer sun from
    melting the growing ice sheets. So how did the Flood cause oceans to become
    40<sup>o</sup> warmer and summers 40<sup>o</sup> colder and for these
    conditions to last for centuries?
</p>
<p>
    Although there is much mystery about the fountains of the deep, it is no
    secret that it is a lot hotter as you descend towards the center of the
    earth. Whatever those fountains poured out heated the ocean. Additionally,
    scientists discovered a 45,000-mile fault on the bottom of the deep oceans.
    Molten rock that poured out of this fault also heated the ocean. But how
    could so much heat remain in the ocean for centuries? The Flood also caused
    the breakup of the one continent. Over the centuries the pieces moved to
    their present location to become separate continents and islands. As the
    pieces (or plates) moved rock ground on rock to produce the friction that
    sustained the ocean's heat.
</p>
<p>
    This activity released volcanic ash which formed a thin layer high in the
    atmosphere. Scientists have learned that volcanic ash impedes the flow of
    heat but not light. The ash in the sky reflected enough of the sun's heat
    back into space to drop summer temperatures by up to 40<sup>o</sup> and
    allow enough of the winter snow to remain to produce those ice sheets.
    Hence the Flood also supplied the opposite needed condition, the cold. When
    the earth finally settled down summer heat returned and the ice sheets
    melted. The Ice Age was over.
</p>
<p>
    Undeniable conclusions can be drawn from an ice age following the Flood.
    First, since there was only one Flood, there could have been but one ice
    age. Second, those who regard the Flood as local or regional have no
    mechanism to produce the Ice Age and face the same dilemma the secular
    scientists face. Yet secular science does not doubt that ice ages occurred.
    Geologists have found no end of evidence for the Ice Age and that evidence
    invariably rests on top of the geological formations produced by the Flood.
    Clearly the Ice Age followed the Flood. Finally, the Ice Age supports our
    contention that Job's ordeal occurred half a millennium before Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    The warm ocean water grew a great plain of grass on the narrow strip of
    land between the Asian Artic Ocean and the mountains further inland. As the
    Ark's animal population multiplied elephants migrated to these distant
    shores, attracted by its warm climate and abundant grass. Lacking natural
    predators, they came to number in the millions and developed into a
    distinct subset of the elephant kind called Woolley mammoths. Eventually
    they became stranded, cut off from the world to the south. When the Ice Age
    waned the intense cold, dwindling fresh water and lack of grass spelled
    their demise. For centuries explorers thought they had drowned in the
    Flood. Recently, more careful examination showed they were buried in loess,
    the dust produced by rock grinding on rock. Now their extinction is
    attributed to that final period of the Ice Age when the ocean became cold
    and grass no longer grew along those artic shores.
</p>
<p>
    While Scripture focuses on the Flood's water covering the entire earth and
    killing all air-breathing life outside the Ark, God also said that He would
    destroy the earth: "Behold, I will destroy them [living things] with the
    earth." Genesis 6:13. Because Scripture focuses on the destruction of life,
    this is the focus of <em>Hidden Beauty</em> as well as commentators in
    general. Of significance, however, is the destruction of the earth which
    refers to the impact of the Flood and its aftermath on the earth's surface.
    Creation scientists are adding to our knowledge of this second impact of
    the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Descendants of the Flood survivors built the city of Babel and its tower in
    Lower Mesopotamia. God judged mankind by giving each major family group its
    own language. Groups left Southern Mesopotamia to find land for themselves.
    Uz and his descendants settled in Western Arabia and established a region
    called "the land of Uz." As a major land owner in Uz Job would have been a
    member of this people group.
</p>
<p>
    Following the Flood new weather patterns that produced the Ice Age brought
    snow and ice to the upper latitudes while rain-drenching hypercyclones
    ripped through areas nearer the equator, even watering places that seldom
    see rain today. We previously mentioned the work of atmospheric scientist
    Dr. Larry Vardiman, a creationist who modeled these storms. With the
    Persian Gulf at 95<sup>o</sup> his model showed that such a storm would
    have measured 3000 miles in diameter, lasted 18 days and dropped up to 300
    inches of rain in Pakistan and 15 inches on lands that today are desert. It
    is not surprising that many of Noah's descendants sought out the Lower
    Mesopotamian Valley and even Arabia to escape frequent snow and ice storms
    in the mountains of Ararat.
</p>
<p>
    Some generations after Eber, his descendant Joktan found Arabia to be a
    refuge from much of this adverse weather. Although Arabia endured
    hypercyclones produced by the Ice Age, they would have been preferable to
    facing growing ice sheets and months of unceasing ice storms in the upper
    latitudes. Joktan's 13 sons populated Arabia and Job was still trading with
    their descendants at the end of the Ice Age. While most of Arabia is a
    desert today and its population is small, it may have held a substantial
    portion of the world's population by the time the Ice Age reached its peak.
    About eight generations after the birth of Job, Peleg, brother of Joktan in
    the broad sense of also being a descendant of Eber, was born in that
    general area. The ice sheets had melted. The Great Ice Age was over. Peleg
    was given the name which means "divided by water" because the oceans now
    contained the melt water from the vast ice sheets and covered the land
    bridges, dividing the continents by water.
</p>
<p>
    It took over 2000 years for the earth to settle down and reach relative
    calm after the Flood. If this violence were charted the line would start
    high on the left side, immediately plunge to represent the first forty days
    of the Flood, then begin curving and reach almost horizontal after 2000
    years. Only 35-55 missing generations in Shem's line provides sufficient
    time for this graph.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Progressive Revelation of the Names for God</strong>
</p>
<p>
    One last significant argument for dating Job early needs to be included
    before closing this section of our book: the extensive presence of the noun
    "Shaddai," an early form for the name of God. When Abraham (Abram) was 99
    years old God made a covenant with him, declaring that he would be the
    father of many nations, that God would give the land of Canaan to his
    offspring, that he would be called Abraham (father of a multitude), that
    Sarai would be called Sarah (mother of nations) and that God would give him
    a son through barren Sarah. He assured Abraham that He could do all this by
    using a new name-El Shaddai (Hebrew); "God Almighty" (English):
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>1</sup>
        When Abram was ninety-nine years old the LORD appeared to Abram and
        said to him, "I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]; walk before me and be
        blameless, <sup>2</sup>that I may make my covenant between me and you,
        and multiply you greatly." Genesis 17:1-2.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This revelation was made about 2067 BC. Then 600 years later when God
    called Moses, about 1447 BC, He made Himself known as Jehovah/Yahweh
    (depending on vowel pointing) which is translated LORD in most English
    Bibles and means "I am," the self-existent one, the One who always existed.
    In Exodus 6:2-3 God actually distinguishes when these two names were
    revealed:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        God spoke to Moses and said to him, "I am the LORD [I am-the eternally
        existing one; Jehovah]. <sup>3</sup>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob, as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by my name the LORD
        [Jehovah] I did not make myself known to them." (Brackets ours.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Concerning El Shaddai, God's name first given to Abraham, El is the
    masculine singular form for God while Shaddai is a word with an uncertain
    origin. The meanings of possible roots in various languages include power,
    breast (nourishment) and mountain but it is commonly rendered "Almighty."
    What does this have to do with Job?
</p>
<p>
    Shaddai was a name for God before He revealed Himself as El Shaddai to
    Abraham. Shaddai is found by itself about 41 times in Scripture and 31 are
    in Job. The compound name (El Shaddai) is found six times between God's
    revelation to Abraham and his revelation to Moses 600 years later but
    according to Exodus 6:2-3, it was used frequently. It is found once later
    in the Old Testament-in Ezekiel 10:5 when the Shekinah Glory departed the
    Temple. Once the strongest word for God, LORD/Jehovah, was given, the
    lesser words, Shaddai and El Shaddai were used infrequently. Since the
    early word for God, Shaddai, is found abundantly in Job, it suggests that
    Job lived before Abraham. This progression is difficult to see because
    Moses in his work of compiling and editing inserted the strongest name,
    LORD/Jehovah, when appropriate in both the books of Genesis and Job.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk69804571">
        <strong>Takeaway from Job: Creation, a Pathway to Faith</strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Biblical inerrancy does not allow relegating the book of Job to allegory or
    myth. It speaks of real people with real experiences. Job's friends had
    educated minds and spoke from a wealth of knowledge and experience. Their
    early place in the post-Flood history of mankind helps future generations
    to understand more clearly that God has always instructed men in His ways.
    Ultimately the book of Job shows God's love and concern for all His
    creation, especially those made in His image.
</p>
<p>
    But think on this: God has an ongoing relationship, almost unmentioned in
    Scripture, with the holy and fallen angels. Man needed to be aware of this
    relationship because it affects man. God held assemblies for the entire
    population of heaven and on two reported occasions, man's devotion to God
    was in question. Satan, our accuser, is galled by our love for God. To get
    this idea out God threw His most prized human servant under the train. Then
    to restore the trust of that servant, He made a personal visit to him and
    allowed his four detractors to witness it. If that wasn't enough, the visit
    was not to sympathize with that servant but to give a science presentation
    on creation and God's providential care of it, the likes of which is
    unequaled in biblical revelation or human history.
</p>
<p>
    But what about Behemoth and Leviathan? If the contest of heaven in chapter
    one and two of Job reflects the heavenly conflict begun before creation,
    certainly God's reminder to us of the evil of Satan via literal dragons in
    His animal kingdom is not so hard to swallow. Such unity of Scripture is
    its beauty. This relationship between Job and Genesis, dragons in Genesis
    and Revelation, is but an early example of the Bible's ongoing saga
    regarding sin and God's answer for it.
</p>
<p>
    So, on the one hand, finding this truth about God's interaction with the
    leader of the fallen angels in the book of Job challenges creation folks to
    believe that Job lived when Scripture places him-after the Flood but
    considerably before Abraham and even some generations before Peleg.
    Clearly, generations are omitted in Shem's genealogy. As Hebrews 1:1
    declares, God has revealed Himself "at many times and in many ways."
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, believers who say "how old the earth is doesn't matter"
    need to move beyond that and see the importance of understanding all
    Scripture so that they may be "thoroughly furnished unto all good works"
    (II Timothy 3:17). This includes these foundational truths of Satan,
    revealed in the Book of Job-his nature and tactics illustrated by living,
    dangerous dragons which are not myths and did not die out or even live 65
    million years ago but still populated the earth in Job's day four and one
    half millennia ago.
</p>
<p>
    Is it too much to believe how highly God considers creation in helping our
    faith? Of course, unbelievers maintain the book of Job is late and a
    product of the human mind. Yet how do they explain how man could formulate
    the science questions God Himself posed in chapters 38 and 39? They are the
    stuff of modern science, today's science. Some are even the stuff of
    tomorrow's science. Absent in Job are mythical exaggerations and errors
    characteristic of ancient secular writings.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, believing in God can be hard. In our entire lifetime we will
    never see Him. In fact, in our lifetime billions of people will live and
    never see Him. Then God says that even one sin keeps us out of heaven. He
    says His son was judged on a cross for all our sins so that when we receive
    this substitute, God can forgive our sins and give us eternal life. That is
    very hard to believe. But while we can't see God, and His salvation message
    is foreign to human experience, we can see creation. We see His creation
    from the time we wake until we go to sleep. We see people, animals,
    insects, mountains, oceans, forests and the sky with sun and stars.
    Creation is that bridge to faith in the unseen God and His remedy for man's
    sinful condition. If the enemy wants to destroy us today, he has to get us
    to think that creation has always been around, or that it made itself, or
    that it came to be in some other way than by the design of the Creator. A
    vast enterprise works to keep such ideas circulating. But holding
    evolutionary belief is becoming more and more ridiculous.
</p>
<p>
    Current science acknowledges DNA as the blueprint for life found in the
    cells of all living things. But it is going haywire. Mutations keep
    accumulating. Science knows some are really harmful and will take the life
    of that living thing apart from heroic coping efforts. What happened to
    natural selection? So believing in God and His salvation should not be that
    difficult-it is mostly a matter of getting the right information. At the
    least is taking the book of Job at face value. After all, creation is the
    link between the seen and the unseen.
</p>
<p>
    Literary giants have heaped their accolades on the Book of Job. Alfred Lord
    Tennyson called it "the greatest poem, whether of ancient or modern
    literature." Thomas Carlyle said Job was "one of the grandest things ever
    written." Father of the modern creation movement Dr. Henry Morris II called
    it the most remarkable book in the Bible. By confirming the absence of
    names in Shem's genealogy, it has become even greater, grander and more
    remarkable.
