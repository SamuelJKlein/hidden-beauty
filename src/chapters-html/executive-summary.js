    <em>Hidden Beauty</em>
    offers to the Body of Christ a promising solution to a nagging and
    contentious Bible problem that has escaped explanation for two thousand
    years. The problem has to do with whether Shem's genealogy in Genesis 11 is
    complete or not, and if not, where and how many names are omitted.
    Historically, the Church has interpreted it as complete, but this view
    conflicts with numerous other Scriptures. Further, recent discoveries of
    huge numbers of cuneiform tablets testify to an earlier Flood date than is
    found by adding the numbers in Shem's genealogy. We propose that Shem's
    list has been shortened from 45-65 names to ten which means the Flood of
    Noah occurred nearer 4000 BC than 2500 BC. This solution eliminates the
    many biblical conflicts, confirms recent cuneiform finds and comes with a
    book full of biblical support.
</p>
<p>
    One of those many biblical conflicts involves the Levi-Aaron genealogy.
    Four times the sequence of Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron is stated or inferred (I
    Chronicles 6:1-3; Numbers 3:17-20, 26:57-59; Exodus 6:16, 18, 20). The
    thinking goes that if it omits names, even though those passages give no
    hint that names are omitted, maybe Shem's list also omits names. In Levi's
    case the issue turns on whether Israel sojourned in Egypt 215 or 430-years.
    If 215-years, it could be complete; if 430-years, it cannot be complete.
    Thus, many of those who add Shem's numbers have supported 215-years in a
    never-ending 2000-year controversy. When it comes to the lives of Abraham
    and Jacob, they have invoked unusual explanations to uphold 215-years. The
    key verse, Exodus 12:40, allowed either interpretation until scholars in
    modern times corrected a textual problem in it. Now it clearly states, "The
    time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years." (ESV). Levi's
    list is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
    For 65 years I have studied the Bible as inerrant which means that God was
    behind the writing of every word of the Bible so its original documents
    were error free. Since 1998 I have had a growing realization of the problem
with Shem's list. More recently I began searching the Bible for an answer.    <strong> </strong>The Shem passage is clear-when Arpachshad had lived 35
    years, he fathered Shelah; when Shelah had lived 30 years he fathered Eber,
    etc., etc., (Genesis 11:12 and following). Since God moved the writers of
    Scripture and God cannot lie, people of faith are obligated to take those
    numbers literally. While most Evangelical Old Testament scholars suspect
    Shem's list is incomplete, they can't explain how or where.
</p>
<p>
    Slowly it dawned on me that Hebrew genealogies had a different orientation
    than the genealogies of most other people groups. Their purpose served to
    identify descendants with forefathers and forefathers with descendants
    rather than establish legal descent. In the thinking of the Hebrew all male
    descendants were the sons of their forefathers and all forefathers were the
    fathers of their descendants.
</p>
<p>
    This thinking is reflected in the very first verse of the New Testament:
    "Jesus Christ, the son of David." Since David lived 1000 years before
    Christ, calling Jesus the "son of David" is using "son" in the broad sense
    of the word. Jesus was a descendant of David. The Hebrews used the other
    common family terms such as "father," "brother" and even "to bear" (the
    mother's part), "to beget" (the father's part) in the same way, i.e., in
    the broad sense as well as in the conventional narrow sense. My favorite
    verse illustrating this concept is I Chronicles 4:1 which uses "son" in
    both narrow and broad senses: "The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur
    and Shobal." Perez is the only immediate son of Judah in the list. You
    would never know from the verse that Hezron was a grandson, Hur and Shobal
    were great grandsons and Carmi was a distant descendant. Yet this was one
    way the Hebrews used "son" and other family terms.
</p>
<p>
    In Shem's case not only is the word "beget" found, but also the age of the
    father when he begat his son. It would seem that this additional
    information requires "beget" to be understood in the narrow sense, but it
    doesn't. Levi's list shows how to take the begetting age. In a Hebrew
    genealogical list factual data about a parent refers to the next
    generation, whether named or omitted. If omitted, "beget/bear" is used in
    the broad sense of a descendant born further down the line.
</p>
<p>
    But where and how many generations are missing in Shem's case? The Bible
    gives an overwhelming clue. All those who died before the Flood lived about
    the same number of years. On the other hand, the longevity of those born
    after the Flood steadily declined from 438 to 70 years (Genesis 11:12;
    Psalm 90:10). While there were special cases the overall decline appears
    small to begin with, then varies from four to eight years per generation
    before eventually declining to about two or three years per generation and
    finally ceasing. But there is one glaring exception. The decline between
    the third and fourth names is 61% of the total decline. By dividing this
    huge decline by the per-generation decline and making other adjustments,
    35-55 generations seem to be missing (1300-1900 years). What clarified this
    issue? Here was the break through: coming to realize that the Flood itself
    was so violent that it permanently cut human longevity in half.
</p>
<p>
    The multiplication of Noah's descendants totally agrees with the appearance
    of the world's first advanced societies. An advanced society is defined as
    one that has developed a written language. After the Ark came to rest where
    the mountains of Ararat eventually arose, Noah's descendants migrated to
    the plains of Southern Mesopotamia and built a city (Genesis 8-11). In
    seeing this city God said that now nothing they proposed would be
    impossible (Genesis 11:6) so He confused their tongues. Speaking different
    languages forced them to spread out. After a time one group reduced its
    language to writing. Secular history has concluded that the very first
    society to develop a written language was the Southern Mesopotamian people
    of Sumer about 3000 BC. The Egyptians soon followed with hieroglyphics.
    Other Near East peoples adopted their languages to Sumer's cuneiform
    script. Secular history confirms Scripture's record with regard to the
    location of the world's first advanced societies.
</p>
<p>
    Noah's Flood brought on the Ice Age which lasted possibly a thousand years
    and impacted all of his descendants for centuries. Those who settled in the
    upper latitudes resorted to survival tactics-stone tools and caves. Those
    in the lower latitudes experienced powerful and frequent rain storms that
    caused permanent vegetation in areas of the Near East now desert. As a
    result, large populations developed in one place while cave men fought to
    survive elsewhere at the same time. Job lived about 16 generations before
    Abraham, dying at the age of 280. His book speaks of these heavy rains,
    numerous other ice age phenomena, an extensive population in Arabia and
    even dinosaurs in the Jordan Valley, all forgotten by Abraham's day.

    When one understands how to take Hebrew genealogies and applies that
    knowledge to Shem's list, dozens of misinterpretations of Scripture are
corrected and Scripture stands with greater trustworthiness and authority.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> is long because it must overcome much
    disinformation. Determine for yourself if the following pages are
    convincing or not.
