<h2>
    Abbreviated/Condensed Genealogies
</h2>
<p>
    Having seen numerous biblical examples of the broad use of kinship terms,
    we are now prepared to observe how they are used in genealogical lists to
    skip generations. At first this idea is unsettling, but as we set aside the
    typical idea of how genealogical lists should work and allow our minds to
    interact with the Scriptures themselves, we will conclude that, indeed,
    Hebrew genealogies often left out unnecessary or unknown names.
    Abbreviating genealogies made them more efficient and decidedly less
    tedious. Many examples follow. <a name="__DdeLink__5772_1878803623"></a>See
    the Appendix for a table to illustrate each example.
</p>
<p>
    All Hebrews descended from one of Jacob's twelve sons. The name of each son
    became a tribe so all descendants of Jacob were members of one of the
    tribes. Jacob adopted Joseph's two sons so when Joseph's name is removed
    and his two sons replace him, Israel had 13 tribes, not 12. But God
    assigned the tribe of Levi to minister to the spiritual needs of Israel.
    That tribe did not fight in the army and it did not have its own portion of
    the land. Rather it was scattered throughout the other twelve tribes and
    supported by those twelve tribes. As a result, one might think of Israel as
    having twelve normal tribes and one special tribe.
</p>
<p>
    Each of the 13 "tribes" was further broken down into "clans" as the tribe's
    population grew. In time each "clan" was further broken down into
    "households." Population counts usually involved only adult males. Tribes
    numbered from 25,000-75,000 adult males; clans numbered from thousands to
    tens of thousands; households numbered from hundreds to thousands. The
    genealogies of those who descended from Jacob usually began with those
    three levels of division-tribe, clan and household. If the individual was
    well known, the fourth name would be that of the individual to whom the
    genealogy belonged.
</p>
<p>
    This chapter comes in two versions. First it summarize each example. Then
    it will present the list of examples with all their details which include
    important stories.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 1 - Aaron, Israel's First High Priest</strong>
    . Since Aaron was well known just four names expressed his genealogy:
    Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron (Exodus 6:16-20). Levi was his tribal ancestor;
    Kohath was his clan ancestor and Amram was his household ancestor. In this
    way his genealogy names three immediate individuals that began his line and
    lived at the beginning of the 430-year sojourn in Egypt then skips down
    about 300 years or 8-12 generations to him. Thus, the four names represent
    12-16 successive fathers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Examples 2-7 - Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan and Zelophehad's
        daughters.
    </strong>
    Each follows the pattern of Aaron's genealogy with minor exceptions when
    needed. Korah, Dathan and Abiram were well known so their list follows the
    pattern of Aaron's list: tribe, clan, household and individual. On was
    apparently less important among the rebels so only his tribe, clan and
    himself are given. Achan was not widely known so his father, Carmi, is
    added. The daughters of Zelophehad were also not widely known, so their
    grandfather as well as their father were added.
</p>
<p>
    When stories are included, we can see that genealogies are far more than
    lists of names. They are historical references to key events and
    individuals in the life of the nation divided by timelines and
    circumstances. We learn of its struggles, heroes and villains. We learn how
    God worked through His people in relationship to their calling as a nation
    with its tribes, clans and households. He blessed them; but held them
    responsible for their disobedience.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples 8-9 -Sheerah and Joshua. </strong>
    (I Chronicles 7:20-27). These lists are among the most complicated lists to
    unscramble that can be unscrambled. Expositors see this list of names as
    one continuous line when it actually consists of two lines. Generally
    unseen, these verses commemorate the lives of two outstanding individuals
    in the tribe that otherwise was notorious for dividing Israel, the tribe of
    Ephraim. The problem is that a descendant was named Ephraim after the
    tribal father whose name was Ephraim. The first list contains nine names
    beginning with Ephraim number one who was born shortly before 1876 BC and
    ends with the daughter of the Ephraim number two. She was famous for
    founding or developing two major towns in Ephraim possibly 500 years after
    Ephraim number one. In verse 25 the writer goes back to pick up another son
    of Ephraim number one and goes down to Joshua. It also contains nine
    generations. While listing nine generations, each of these lists still
    omits many generations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 10 - Caleb, the Believing Spy</strong>
    . He was so famous that Scripture does not give his genealogy so some may
    object that the Bible does not abbreviate his list. The objection is sound,
    but research gives so many names in his line that much of it can be
    reconstructed. However, because it still omits names it stands abbreviated
    as it is given piecemeal in the Pentateuch and Joshua.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 11 - King David</strong>
    . This is almost like presenting four examples because David's line is
    found four times in the Old and New Testaments. It is first found at the
    end of Ruth when she bears a son to Boaz. It begins with Perez who was one
    of the twins born to Judah about the time Jacob moved his family to Egypt
    (1876 BC) and concludes with David who died about 970 BC. If this list were
    complete each son would be born when his father was 90. Fortunately, the
    names are familiar. In looking at it the first three lived early in the
    Egyptian sojourn. The next three lived over 300 years later at the time of
    the Exodus and conquest of Canaan. Then the list moves down to the end of
    the Judges to name three immediate forefathers of David and finally David
    himself.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 12 -- Israel's Priesthood. </strong>
    As with most other genealogical lists, even the priesthood of Israel
    omitted names at times. This fact emphasizes how Hebrew genealogies were
    mostly about identity, not about complete lists establishing legal descent.
    In contrast historical genealogies in Western societies were precise
    records of descent. While the following example records the genealogy of a
    priest that omits generations and was presumably written by that priest,
    Scripture contains other examples of omitted names in priesthood records.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 13 -- Ezra the Priest and Scribe</strong>
    . Ezra (7:1-5) omits six consecutive generations in his list when compared
    to the official list of priests in Chronicles. He had his reasons and they
    probably were not associated with efficiency or avoiding tediousness, but
    his list clearly omits six names and shows that skipping names in a
    genealogy was acceptable in Israel.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples 14-16 - The Three Leaders of the Temple Singers</strong>
    . David appointed Heman as the senior choir director. Heman had both
    outstanding and shady ancestors. His grandfather was the prophet and judge,
    Samuel, but the infamous Korah was also in Heman's line. His line follows
    the pattern of Aaron's line during the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, omitting
    8-12 generations. then, from Korah to his own day, it contains 19 names and
    is complete. It spans the years from the birth of Levi about 1891 BC to his
    appointment by David about 1000 BC. However, it is complete from the
    rebellion of Korah about 1444 BC to David. That complete portion contains
    19 names. On the other hand, the genealogies of the two other choirmasters,
    Asaph and Ethan, are examples of incomplete lists during that period.
    Asaph's line contains 12 names and Ethan's line contains 10.
</p>
<h2>
    Details to the 16 Examples Above
</h2>
<p>
    <strong>Introduction</strong>
    . Nearly half of all the Old Testament verses containing genealogies relate
    to the tribes of Levi and Judah. This makes sense since God chose the tribe
    of Levi to minister to Israel's spiritual life and the tribe of Judah to
    supply its rulers and the Savior. In Example #1 (Levi-Aaron) three
    generations were used to establish a line from the tribal founder, Levi, to
    the individual under consideration, Aaron. The organizational plan Moses
    followed was: first level, the tribe of Levi; second level, the clan of
    Kohath (Levi's son); third level, the household level of Amram (Levi's
    grandson).
</p>
<p>
    Level two, the clan level, is identified by several different titles in
    various parts of the Old Testament. Consequently, some modern authors refer
    to it as the division level. Scripture also uses several terms
    interchangeably for the third level so some authors call this third level
    the clan level. For sake of clarity, we will call the first level the tribe
    level, the second level the clan level and the third level the household
    level.
</p>
<p>
    A refinement that might be overlooked involves counting generations. In a
    list each person represents a generation. But when determining changes
    between generations, it takes two generations to produce a change. Thus,
    one must count from the birth of the first to the birth of the second as
    one generation. When working with averages, the average number of years in
a generation must be determined. Because the length of generations varied,    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> visits this subject multiple times.
</p>
<p>
    One cannot presume that the firstborn is always the chosen successor. Judah
    was the fourth born of Jacob yet the royal line of Israel was established
    through him, not Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Aaron's third born, Eleazar,
    carried on the line of the high priesthood. Even further, one's firstborn
    might be a female as in the case of Mariam being the oldest child of the
    unnamed parents of Mariam, Aaron and Moses. In counting Aaron's children
    only four males are named. The law of averages would suggest he had
    daughters as well. If he had four daughters and four sons and they
    alternated-female, male-his designated heir, Eleazar, would have been his
    fifth child. Thus, we estimate Aaron's age as 30 when Eleazar was born
    rather than 25 when he would have begun fathering children.
</p>
<p>
    As to the length of a generation, 25 is used for an average during this
    period. It began when Jacob's sons started to have children. Chapter seven
    explains that human longevity declined 2-8 years per generation from the
    Flood to the death of Moses. Paralleling this decline, the start of new
    generations declined. In the list of Genesis 11 new generations began every
    29-35 years. By the time Jacob's sons began having families, new
    generations were starting every 19-28 years. Unusual circumstances, such as
    Joseph's imprisonment resulting in his first son arriving when he was about
    36, are noted but not considered average.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 1 Details-Aaron</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    <sup>57</sup>
    This was the list of the Levites according to their clans:&#8230; of
    Kohath, the clan of the Kohathites;&#8230; <sup>58</sup>And Kohath was the
    father of Amram. <sup>59</sup>The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed the
    daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt. And she bore to Amram
    Aaron and Moses and Miriam their sister. Numbers 26:57-59.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter one demonstrated beyond doubt that the Levi-Aaron genealogy of
    Exodus six and Numbers 26 is an abbreviated or condensed genealogy. It
    lists only Levi, his son Kohath and his grandson Amram before skipping down
    to Aaron. The list appears four times (Exodus 6:16-20; Numbers 26:57-59; I
    Chronicles 6:1-3; I Chronicles 23:6, 12-13), always with the same fathers
    and sons-Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Levi was the immediate father of Kohath,
    so Kohath was the immediate son of Levi; Kohath was the immediate father of
    Amram, so Amram was the immediate son of Kohath; however, Amram was not the
    immediate father of Aaron and Aaron was not the immediate son of Amram. Up
    to twelve generations are omitted between Amram and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    The text also adds numerous details about individuals in the list. Among
    them, the Exodus passage relates that Amram married a woman called Jochebed
    and that this woman was his father's sister and she bore him Moses as well
    as Aaron. The Numbers passage adds that she was the daughter of Levi born
    in Egypt and she bore him Miriam as well as Aaron and Moses. Since Amram
    was born in Egypt, he married an aunt who was about his age. His
    descendants, Aaron, Moses and Mariam would become central figures in the
    wilderness wanderings some four hundred years later. Lesson: many details
    can be added to an apparent immediate father-son listing even though
    numerous intermediate generations are skipped. The details relate to the
    first unborn son, not the named son/offspring.
</p>
<p>
    From the text alone the reader would never guess that Aaron, Moses and
    Miriam were separated from Amram and Jochebed by many generations. Moses,
    the writer, had no intention of deceiving his audience. People of that day
    knew their national history, so they knew he skipped generations. Moses
    correctly used Hebrew genealogies because their purpose was to knit a
    nation together. These three descendants of Levi had to be tightly bound to
    Jacob's lineage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 2 Details-Korah</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now Korah the son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, and Dathan and
    Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth [Pallu], sons of Reuben,
    took men. <sup>2</sup>And they rose up before Moses, with a number of the
    people of Israel, 250 chiefs of the congregation, chosen from the assembly,
    well-known men. Numbers 16:1-2.
</p>
<p>
    Numbers 16:1-2 contains four examples of abbreviated genealogies-Korah,
    Dathan, Abiram and On. Korah was of the tribe of Levi while Dathan, Abiram
    and On were of the tribe of Reuben. The lists of Korah and of Dathan and
    Abiram will be examined next. The writer gave the tribe, clan and household
    identities of the first three, but omitted the household to which On
    belonged. In this way the On listing is the shortest list on record.
</p>
<p>
    The genealogy of Korah follows the basic pattern of tribe, clan and
    household. Numbers 16:1 tells that Korah, like Aaron, was a descendant of
    Levi. Further, like Aaron he was from the Levite clan of Kohath. But
    whereas Aaron traced his line through Kohath's oldest son Amram, Korah
    traced his line through Kohath's second son Izhar. However, merely
    discussing names without faces and actions doesn't grasp the mind like
    associating names with specific events. So here is the background.
</p>
<p>
    Korah got others to join him in challenging the leadership of Aaron and
    Moses. He envied the honor and privileges of Aaron's position as high
    priest. He found sons of Reuben who were equally envious of Moses (tribe of
    Levi) who exercised supreme authority in civil affairs. After all, Reuben
    was the oldest son of Jacob, not Levi. Traditionally, family leadership was
    the right of the firstborn. Two brothers controlling the entire nation had
    to be changed. They found 250 princes of Israel to join their uprising.
    This delegation marched on the Tent of Meeting to confront Aaron and Moses,
    undoubtedly accompanied by an unruly mob of supporters.
</p>
<p>
    With indignation this horde threw down their challenge: "Why do you exalt
    yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?" (Numbers 16:3). What they
    forgot was that God had chosen the nation's leaders. In the end God opened
    up the earth to swallow the rebel instigators and fire consumed the 250
    princes. Those 250 princes ranked among the celebrities of the nation. The
    next day the entire congregation grumbled against Aaron and Moses, blaming
    them for getting their princes killed. God sent a plague. Only the quick
    intervention of Aaron and Moses prevented the loss of the entire nation. As
    it was, the plague took the lives of 14,700 people in just hours. The
    divinely sent plague abruptly ended the rebellion.
</p>
<p>
    Numbers 16:1 abbreviates Korah's genealogy. It lists the first three
    generations of the Patriarch Jacob's third son-Levi, Kohath and Izhar-and
    then skips down 300 years to Korah. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt
    (1876 BC), Levi was about 46 years old while his son Kohath's was an
    estimated 20. Thus, Kohath's sons, Amram and Izhar, belonged to the first
    generation born in Egypt. Like Aaron and Moses, Korah was born over 300
    years and up to 12 generations later.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples 3-5 Details-Dathan, Abiram, On.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the clan of
    the Hanochites; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluites; <sup>6</sup>of Hezron,
the clan of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the clan of the Carmites.    <sup>7</sup>These are the clans of the Reubenites, and those listed were
    43,730. <sup>8</sup>And the sons of Pallu: Eliab. <sup>9</sup>The sons of
    Eliab: Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram, chosen
    from the congregation who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company
    of Korah, when they contended against the LORD, <sup>10</sup>and the earth
    opened its mouth and swallowed them up together with Korah, when that
    company died, when the fire devoured 250 men, and they became a warning.
    Numbers 26:5-10.
</p>
<p>
    The genealogies of Dathan and Abiram are further identified in Numbers 16
    because of their part in the Korah rebellion. These men were born in the
    tribe of Reuben, Jacob's firstborn. Due to their role of leaders in the
    notorious attack on Moses they are also singled out in the second census of
    Israel found in Numbers 26 (above). Whereas the Numbers 26 census mostly
    lists tribes and clans, in the case of the tribe of Reuben, the census
    includes four verses on one household of the Pallu clan, the household of
    Elias (verses 8-11). Then the census tells that Dathan and Abiram were sons
    of Elias, ie, were descendants of the household of Elias. Without the
    identification of their household, we would only know their tribe and clan.
</p>
<p>
    Reuben was about 48 when they moved to Egypt. Pallu would have been about
    20 since he is listed second among Reuben's four sons. Elias is not listed
    among those who went down to Egypt, so he would have been the first of his
    line born in Egypt. Dathan and Abiram were born over 350 years after the
    birth of Elias. This notice follows the pattern of listing three
    consecutive generations then skipping down to the individual under
    discussion. In doing so it passes over up to 13 generations in the same way
    the genealogies of Aaron and Korah passed over up to 12 generations.
</p>
<p>
    On is only named in Numbers 16 which records this dangerous rebellion
    against Aaron and Moses. Like Dathan and Abiram, he was a member of the
    tribe of Reuben. His line is similar to theirs with one exception. Even his
    household is not given. This is probably due to the other two playing a
    greater role in attacking the leadership of Moses. The remaining names are
    simply Reuben (tribe)-Peleth/Pallau (clan)-On (individual). His list is
    abbreviated indeed.
</p>
<p>
    Before tackling more complicated condensed or abbreviated genealogies,
    Scripture gives four other genealogies that occur during this period-those
    of Achan, the daughters of Zelophehad, Joshua and Caleb. Each generally
    follows the pattern established above: tribe, clan and household. But
    further names are added to those who were unknown.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 6 Details--Achan</strong>
    .
</p>
<p>
    But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things for
    Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah,
    took some of the devoted things. And the anger of the LORD burned against
    the people of Israel. Joshua 7:1.
</p>
<p>
    Achan descended from Judah who raised twins after his first three sons were
    grown. Their names were well known; they formed two large clans in Israel.
    The more prominent twin, Perez, became the forefather of Caleb the spy,
    David and Jesus Christ. We will learn much of Perez's descendants. The
    lesser known twin was Zerah and from this son of Judah Achan descended. One
    of Zerah's sons was named Zabdi. He represents level three, the household
    level, in the organization of Israel.
</p>
<p>
    The twins (Zerah and Perez) were born about the time Jacob moved his large
    family to Egypt so Zabdi would have been born 25-30 years later, say about
    1850 BC. Achan served with over 600,000 other sons of Israel in Joshua's
    army that destroyed Jericho. Thus, Achan would have been military age
    (between the ages of 20 and 50) at the time of Jericho's fall in 1406 BC.
    Because he had considerable livestock and a considerable family, he was
    more likely nearer 50 than 20, so he would have been born about 1450 BC or
    400 years after Zabdi was born (1850-1450=400).
</p>
<p>
    Achan possessed oxen, donkeys and sheep as well as sons and daughters
    (Joshua 7:24). Possibly his lack of honesty had infected his entire
    household and had contributed to his prosperity. While the sons of Israel
    did not have first and last names, their father's name was sometimes given
    to help identify them. Since Achan was an obscure thief his immediate
    father, Carmi, was named. Carmi did not pass before Joshua and the priest,
    so most likely he belonged to the generation that died in the wilderness.
    If typical he would have been born 25-30 years (1480-1475 BC) before Achan.
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, three generations are used to locate Achan's place in Israel.
    They are immediate father-son generations (Judah-Zerah-Zabdi). Judah
    fathered Zerah who fathered Zabdi. Judah was the tribal father; Zerah
    formed one of the clans of Judah; Zabdi formed one of the households of
    Zerah. So Achan belonged to the tribe of Judah, the clan of Zerah and the
    household of Zabdi. About 400 years after the birth of Zabdi, Achan was
    born. Obviously, many generations came between Zabdi and Achan. We suggest
    12-16. Only one is mentioned, that of Carmi, Achan's immediate father. Due
    to the efficiency of Hebrew genealogies Achan's list is shortened by about
    two-thirds.
</p>
<p>
    It might be helpful at this point to make some observations about Old
    Testament names. Two men named Carmi are found during this period of
    Israel's history. The first was Reuben's fourth son, Carmi, who formed one
    of the four clans of the tribe that Dathan and Abiram belonged to. The
    second Carmi was Achan's father who lived four hundred years after the
    first Carmi and belonged to a different tribe. He is the Carmi in Joshua
    7:1 and is otherwise unknown.
</p>
<p>
    Names were used over and over in Israel and are easy to confuse. The two
    famous Calebs in the line of Judah are a well-known example. There are
    three Elkinah's in the line of Heman. Fathers named sons after an admired
    brother or ancestor. Abraham's brother Nahor was named after their
    grandfather Nahor. Unger's Bible Dictionary lists 23 different Azariah's in
    the Old Testament.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Adding to the challenge of matching the right person with the right name,
    some people were known by two or even three different names and sometimes
    the spelling is rendered several different ways. (The same is true of place
    names which are commonly rendered by different spellings.) Sometimes it is
    impossible to tell if the same name found in different places is the same
    individual or a different individual. The careful student will keep all
    this in mind as he identifies the people in the OT, distinguishing between
    tentative and positive identifications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 7 Details-The Daughters of Zelophehad.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, son of
    Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, from the clans of Manasseh the son
    of Joseph. Numbers 27:1 (cf. Numbers 26:28-33.)
</p>
<p>
    Zelophehad had five daughters but no sons. His daughters came to Moses
    asking for the inheritance of their father so that his name would continue
    in Israel. The LORD said that if a man had no sons, his daughters could
    preserve his name by receiving his portion of land. Their father belonged
    to the family of Hepher the son of Gilead, the son of Machir of the tribe
    of Manasseh. Their recorded line is
    Manasseh-Machir-Gilead-Hepher-Zelophehad-his five daughters-seven
    generations. This follows the pattern we have seen-tribe, Manasseh;
    clan-Machir; household-Gilead-the typical three level identification
    telling an Israelite who he was and with whom he belonged. An additional
    level is included in the daughters of Zelophehad, the family of Hepher.
    This event as we shall see set a precedent.
</p>
<p>
    Now, what are the times involved? Manassah was born shortly before 1876 BC
    while the daughters brought their request to Moses just before his death at
    the end of the 40 years in the wilderness. Most likely they had a range of
    ages from 25 to 40 so they were born shortly after the Exodus. Thus the
    time span is approximately 430-years. At the rate of 25 years per
    generation their list should contain 17 names. It only contains 6. It skips
    about 11. We must conclude that the genealogy of these daughters follows
    the standard practice of naming tribe-clan-household and then skipping down
    to their father, adding only the family of Hepher and that up to 11
    generations are omitted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Examples 8 and 9 Overview-Sheerah and Joshua, I Chronicles 7:20-27.
    </strong>
    Interpreters are all over the map in their explanations of these verses due
    to duplication of names, the brevity of the list and the grammatical
    construction. While they are examples of abbreviated genealogies, they also
    reveal practices previously pointed out-the naming of descendants after
    forefathers and the compactness of lists. There is yet another reason for
    including this complicated passage: failure to do so allows it to be used
    to argue against our position. We do not claim to have the final answer,
    but the following interpretation makes far better sense than any other we
    have seen.
</p>
<p>
    First, we must suggest why the Sheerah and Joshua lists are found in
    Chronicles. Two reasons stand out: first, nine chapters record genealogical
    records that established Israel as a nation and second, each tribe had
    notable achievers. Whereas half of the verses in the nine chapters are
    devoted to just two tribes, those of Judah and Levi, only ten verses
    (7:20-29) are devoted to the tribe of Ephraim, one of the smallest but most
    troublesome of all the tribes of Israel.
</p>
<p>
    While Ephraim would later divide the nation and later yet adopt idolatry
    wholesale, in the early days it had its proud moments. Sheerah, for
    instance, was a famous Ephraimite woman who lived after the conquest of
    Canaan when Israel was beginning to build a nation. She established
    significant Ephraimite settlements and is listed in vv20-24. Joshua is much
    better known. He succeeded Moses to command the victorious forces of Israel
    in subduing the Canaanites and is featured in verses 25-27.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 8 Details-Sheerah, I Chronicles 7:20-24. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <sup>20</sup>
    The sons of Ephraim: Shuthelah, and Bered his son, Tahath his son, Eleadah
    his son, Tahath his son, <sup>21</sup>Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son, and
    Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath who were born in the land killed,
    because they came down to raid their livestock. <sup>22</sup>And Ephraim
their father mourned many days, and his brothers came to comfort him.    <sup>23</sup>And Ephraim went in to his wife, and she conceived and bore a
    son. And he called his name Beriah, because disaster had befallen his
    house. <sup>24</sup>His daughter was Sheerah, who built both Lower and
    Upper Beth-horon, and Uzzen-sheerah. I Chron. 7:20-24.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture frankly states that Sheerah's two brothers were killed stealing
    Philistine cattle. Israel lived in the hills; the Philistines lived on the
    coastal plain. The brothers, Ezer and Elead, showed stealth and initiative
    but they violated the territory of Gath, one of the five Philistine
    city-states adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea and paid for it with their
    lives. This theft and their resulting deaths could only have happened after
    Israel had invaded Canaan and captured the land God had promised. Israel
    began the campaign for Canaan with the destruction of Jericho in 1406 BC.
    The campaign for the land took the next ten or twenty years.
</p>
<p>
    What confuses the reader is that Sheerah's father was named Ephraim after
    the founder of the tribe of Ephraim who lived 500 years before. This second
    Ephraim was crushed. He had great plans for the land he received in Canaan
    and his sons were obviously very motivated. Now his plans were shattered
    because he had lost them. Only a daughter remained. His brothers tried to
    comfort him but his mourning lasted many days. Maybe he was already an old
    man with little hope for having another son. Sometime later he saw
    possibilities in his daughter and made her his heir. Such an action had not
    been possible until the daughters of Zelophehad came to Moses just before
    his death about 1406 BC and God revealed that if a man had no sons, only
    daughters, he could designate a daughter as his heir. The death of Ephraim
    number two's sons and his subsequent act of making Sheerah, his daughter,
    his heir could not have happened until Israel began settling in Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    The error of interpretation comes when commentators confuse Ephraim, the
    tribal chief who was Jacob's grandson, with his distant descendant by the
    same name who came along 500 years later. They see a long list of names in
    verses twenty through twenty-seven which ends with Joshua and craft a story
    about how sons of Ephraim, the tribal chief, went up from Goshen to loot
    cattle at Gath early in the Egyptian sojourn and eventually Joshua ends
    this long list of descendants. They overlook the fact that Scripture says
    the two brothers went down, not up to steal the cattle.
</p>
<p>
    Instead they conclude that here is a complete list from the beginning of
    the Egyptian sojourn until the conquest of Canaan 500 years later-up to
    eighteen generations (depending on how they are counted). They conclude
    that Scripture does not abbreviate genealogies; families simply had
    traditions of marrying early or late and this accounts for the wide
    variation in the number of people in different lines. Their explanation
    overlooks the entire point of the list-that this second Ephraim's daughter
    pioneered two well-known settlements in Canaan after the Exodus and
    Israel's conquest of Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    The standard interpretation is based on a poor understanding of these eight
    verses. Hebrew scholar C. F. Keil states that seeing but one Ephraim in the
passage makes it incomprehensible    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. But even two lists, one
    ending with Sheerah and a second ending with Joshua, though abbreviated,
    offer far more names than just the two names between Levi and Aaron. These
    two lists provide two more arguments that the Levi-Aaron list is extremely
    condensed and at the same time are themselves examples of abbreviated
    genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    The portion of Sheerah's line recorded here is:
    Ephraim-Shuthelah/Bered-Tahath-Eleadah-Tahath-Zabad-Shuthelah-Ephraim and
    his children-Ezer, Elead, Sheerah and Beriah (three brothers and a sister),
    nine generations. Where the text reads, "Shuthelah and Bered his son,"
    because it does not say "Shuthelah his son, Bered his son," it is commonly
    understood that Shuthelah and Bered were brothers, so these two names
    represent one generation, not two. The text does not identify which brother
    the line passed through.
</p>
<p>
    But most amazing of all, the list is not connected to the second Ephraim.
    You read correctly. The list concludes, "Zabad his son, Shuthelah his son,
    and Ezer and Elead, whom the men of Gath&#8230;killed." The last name in
    this unbroken line is Shuthelah, the son of Zabad. The text does not
    connect the brothers to the second Shuthelah. Apparently, the story of the
    brothers being killed while attempting to take Philistine cattle was well
    known, but the biographer did not have the remaining names in the list to
    link the second Shuthelah with the second Ephraim and his family. How many
    generations are missing? Our standard of 25 years per generation suggests
    eleven generations are omitted.
</p>
<p>
    If all the biographer knew was that this second Ephraim was a distant
    descendant of the tribal chief named Ephraim, why mention this list at all?
    It seems that it is introduced to help the reader place the deaths of the
    second Ephraim's sons in the time of the settlement of Canaan. The point is
    to get to his daughter who did the notable deed of building those famous
    Ephraimite settlements. She could only become the heiress if his only sons
    were dead and God was yet to give him another son.
</p>
<p>
    We suggest that with the death of her two brothers, her father mourned.
    Losing both sons was a great loss. Eventually he made his daughter his heir
    after the pattern of the daughters of Zelophehad. Sometime later God gave
    him another son of whom nothing more is said. But the daughter made a name
    for her father. She was a firebrand in the building of those two Ephraimite
    settlements and thus became a legend in the tribe of Ephraim.
</p>
<p>
    While an unknown number of generations are missing between Shuthelah #2 and
    the second Ephraim (we suggest eleven), the writer does give us seven
    generations between Ephraim and Sheerah, which is 3.5 times as many
    generations as the two between Levi and Aaron. This genealogy testifies to
    the Levi-Aaron line being extremely abbreviated, but illustrates another
    reason for abbreviating a line-the writer did not have the names that tied
    the second Shuthelah to the second Ephraim.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 9 Details-Joshua. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    Rephah was his son, Resheph his son ["his son" not found in the Hebrew],
    Telah his son, Tahan his son, <sup>26</sup>Ladan his son, Amminhud his son,
    Elishama his son, <sup>27</sup>Nun his son, Joshua his son. 1 Chronicles
    7:25-27.
</p>
<p>
    Continuing to unravel the complex record of the tribe of Ephraim, "Rephah
    was his son" (verse 25) has no connection with verses 23-24 which talks
    about a man named Ephraim who lost two sons. Rather, it resumes listing
    further lines from those first introduced in verse twenty. It lists many
    generations and concludes with Joshua who lived in the generation of the
    man who lost his sons. Thus, "Rephah was his son" is not a continuation of
    verse twenty-four but is starting over from verse twenty.
</p>
<p>
    Verse 25 reads, "Rephah was his son, Resheph his son" in the English text.
    "His son" is missing after "Resheph," in the Hebrew text. C. F. Keil notes
that such a construction usually indicates the two were brothers.    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The Hebrews frequently
    named children with pleasant rhyming sounds. "Rephah" and "Resheph" answer
    to that practice which further strengthens the idea that they were
    brothers. The historian is starting over with a new line from Ephraim in
    verse 20 to show Joshua's lineage. Neither Rephah or Resheph are listed in
    Numbers 26 as clans of Ephraim; but, in this list is Tahan and a Tahan is
    listed in Numbers 26 as the head of an Ephramite clan. Therefore, the
    second Tahan is most likely named after his clan's founder and identifies
    Joshua's clan. This list then is as follows: Joseph-Ephraim-Tahan-either
    Rephah or Resheph-Telah-Tahan-Ladan-Ammihud-Elishma-Nun-Joshua, eleven
    generations in all.
</p>
<p>
    Let us compare the generations in Joshua's line to those in Aaron's line.
    Levi is about seven years older than his brother Joseph. Levi began the
    Aaron line while Joseph-Ephraim began the Joshua line. Aaron was 83 at the
    time of the Exodus while Joshua was about 40; so, Joshua's father, Nun,
    would be about Aaron's age. Only two names come between Levi and Aaron
    while eight names come between Joseph and Nun. Each name represents a new
    generation. By this measure 3/4ths of the names are omitted between Levi
    and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    Concerning the integrity of Joshua's list, while Scripture does not tell
    his clan, it repeatedly identifies him as the son of Nun. We also know
    beyond doubt that at the time of the Exodus the chief of Joshua's tribe,
    the tribe of Ephraim, was Elishama and five times in the book of Numbers he
    is said to be the son of Ammihud. The only time these two sets of names
    (Nun-Joshua and Amminhud-Elishama) come together is in the passage before
    us, thus adding further certainty to the names in Joshua's line.
</p>
<p>
    Now an estimate of missing generations in Joshua's line can be made.
    Ephraim was born about 1878 BC while Joshua was born about 1470 BC or 408
    years later. At the rate of 25 years per generation, Joshua was born about
    16 generations after Joseph. Since only eight generations are named, eight
    are omitted.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 10 Details-Caleb. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We have examined the genealogy of Joshua, the spy who represented the tribe
    of Ephraim. Now we tackle the genealogy of the spy who represented the
    tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. But alas, Caleb's genealogy is
    nowhere to be found! He was so famous in his day that apparently no one
    needed his genealogy. Here is the primary record. Combined with other
    passages they clearly identified him in Israel without requiring a
    comprehensive list.
</p>
<p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    Then the people of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. And Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, "You know what the LORD said to Moses
    the man of God in Kadesh-barnea concerning you and me. <sup>7</sup>I was
    forty years old [Joshua was 39] when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me
    from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land&#8230; <sup>9</sup>And Moses swore
    on that day, saying, 'Surely the land on which your foot has trodden shall
    be an inheritance for you and your children forever, because you have
    wholly followed the LORD my God.'" <sup>13</sup>Then Joshua blessed him,
and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.    <sup>14</sup>Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
    Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he wholly followed the LORD,
    the God of Israel. Joshua 14:6-7, 9, 13-14.
</p>
<p>
    After God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai, Israel moved to the edge of
    the Promised Land where Moses sent twelve men to spy out Canaan. Each of
    the twelve was a chief from his respective tribe. At the end of 40 days
    these leaders returned with their findings. Ten said the land flowed with
    milk and honey; but, it was occupied by giants. In comparison, the Hebrews
    seemed like grasshoppers. They concluded, "We are not able to go up against
    the people, for they are stronger than we are" (Numbers 13:31). Two,
    disagreed saying, "Let us go up at once and occupy it, for we are well able
    to overcome it" (Numbers 13:30).
</p>
<p>
    The congregation raised a loud cry and wept that night, saying "Would that
    we had died in the land of Egypt...Why is the LORD bringing us into this
    land, to fall by the sword?...Would it not be better for us to go back to
    Egypt...Let us choose a leader and go back to Egypt" (Numbers 14:1-4). The
    two spies with the favorable report, Joshua representing the tribe of
    Ephraim and Caleb representing the tribe of Judah, said, "If the LORD
    delights in us, he will bring us into this land and give it to us...only do
    not rebel against the LORD and do not fear the people of the land, for they
    are bread for us...their protection is removed from them, and the LORD is
    with us, do not fear them" (Numbers 14:8-9).
</p>
<p>
    With that the congregation prepared to stone Moses, Aaron, Joshua and
    Caleb. Then the glory of the LORD appeared at the tent of meeting, saying,
</p>
<p>
    How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in
    me, in spite of all the signs that I have done among them? <sup>12</sup>I
    will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make
    of you a nation greater and mightier than they. Numbers 14:11-12.
</p>
<p>
    In the face of impending doom Moses pleaded with God, arguing that "If you
    kill this people as one man, then the nations who have heard your fame will
    say, <sup>16</sup>'It is because the LORD was not able to bring this people
    into the land that he swore to give to them, that he has killed them in the
    wilderness'" (Numbers 14:15-16). Moses prevailed. God relented on
    destroying the nation but pronounced judgment: none of the men who saw the
    signs in Egypt would see the Promised Land, except for the faithful spies.
    The congregation would spend one year in the wilderness for each day the
    spies saw the goodness of the Promised Land. Then God sent a plague that
    took the lives of the ten unbelieving spies.
</p>
<p>
    At this point we must recall the importance of Perez. Perez represented the
    powerful impact of the tribe of Judah on Israel's history. Perez is made
    famous by his son Hezron who fathered Jerahmeel, Ram and Caleb. Their lines
    are the subject of I Chronicles 2. The chapter lists 23 generations of
    Hezron's firstborn Jerahmeel (Table 5. 1). It gives the genealogy of Ram
    his second son all the way down to David. Other lists continue that line to
    Christ. Of particular interest to us is Hezron's third son Caleb (also
    called Chelubai).
</p>
<p>
    Again, Perez was born about the time God directed Jacob to relocate in
    (1876 BC). Hezron would have been born about 25 years later and Caleb, as
    Hezron's third son, would have been born about 30 years after his father's
    birth. The key that seems to unlock the door to there being two Calebs is
    the concluding statement in the extensive genealogical information about
    the first Caleb in 1 Chronicles 2. Verse 49 says, "And the daughter of
    Caleb was Achsah."
</p>
<p>
    Achsah is a name given to just one person in the Old Testament and her
    story is most unusual. The second Caleb was 85 when Canaan was conquered
    and Joshua was parceling it out to the tribes. This Caleb was promised
    Hebron because he followed the Lord fully. Now he was requesting his
    inheritance and Joshua granted his request. Caleb drove out the giants in
    one area of Hebron, but those in nearby Debir were too strong for him. He
    promised his daughter's hand in marriage to the warrior that conquered
    Debir. His cousin Othneil was successful and received Achsah.
</p>
<p>
    When 1 Chronicles 2:49 says "the daughter of Caleb [Caleb #1] was Achsah,"
    it is using the word "daughter" in the broad sense of a distant
    granddaughter. Since she was in the first Caleb's line, her immediate
    father, the second Caleb, would obviously also be in this line. The second
    Caleb was named after his famous ancestor, the first Caleb. So his line
    begins: Judah-Perez-Hezron-Caleb and ends with Jephunneh-Caleb-Achsah. Thus
    we have seven names in a period that encompasses about 20 generations.
    Perez was a part of Judah's second family, born after Judah's three sons
    had grown up and two had married. We must count these as two successive
    generations, not one. Now we have identified eight generations in the line
    of Caleb the spy.
</p>
<p>
    Numbers 32:12 and Joshua 14:6 speak of "Caleb the son of Jephunneh the
    Kenizzite." The Kenazzites were an extended family in the tribe of Judah.
    "Son of Kenaz" means a descendant of the father of this household, not
    particularly an immediate son. All of this suggests a number of additional
    generations, anywhere from one to six or even more. Now we are up to nine
    to fourteen generations in the family of Caleb of the tribe of Judah.
</p>
<p>
    But we are not done. This first Caleb had a son named Mareshah who named a
    son Hebron (I Chronicles 2:42). The town of Hebron was extremely important
    in Jewish history, being Abraham's home after he and Lot separated. It
    remains to this day the site where he, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were
    buried. There Abraham enjoyed great favor with God. Apparently Mareshah
    told the story of Abraham's years at Hebron so many times that he ended up
    naming a son after that place of great blessing.
</p>
<p>
    This line of Judah retold the story again and again. When the spy
    assignments were given out, Caleb who was raised on those stories,
    requested the assignment of spying out Hebron. After he gave the good
    report, the LORD promised that his inheritance would be everywhere he
    walked in the Hebron area. When Joshua divided up the land, he upheld God's
    promise by assigning Hebron to Caleb. If our conjecture is correct, we can
    add the names of Mareshah and Hebron to his line: 1-Judah; 2-Judah's first
    family; 3-Perez, part of Judah's second family; 4-Hezron; 5-the first
    Caleb; 6-Mareshah; 7-Hebron plus Kenaz and five to nine generations
    surrounding him and finally, Jephunneh-Caleb-Achsah, a minimum of eleven
    generations and up to twenty generations.
</p>
<p>
    This list shows us how to take Aaron's list. Between Levi and Aaron are
    just two names, Kohath and Amram. Here, between Judah, who was born one
    year after Levi, and Caleb's father, who was the same age as Aaron, are
    seven known generations and an undetermined number of missing generations
    before and after Kenaz. If we assume just five generations are unnamed, we
    have twelve versus the two in Aaron's line. Aaron's line seems to be
    condensed by at least 5/6<sup>ths</sup> when compared to Caleb's line.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine the strain in viewing but one Caleb to uphold a 215-year Egyptian
    sojourn. Somehow the first Caleb is the only Caleb. He is both the son of
    Hezron and the son of Jephunneh. He lived early in the Egyptian sojourn and
    he lived after the Exodus, the 40 years in the desert and the conquest of
    Canaan. What a difficult position! But a 430-year Egyptian sojourn fully
    accommodates the spy's line.
</p>
<h4>
    Tripping up Bible Students
</h4>
<p>
    As we have seen the Hebrews often named sons after famous forefathers or
    beloved relatives. In Sheerah's list are three such examples: a first and
    second Ephraim, a first and second Shuthelah and a first and second Tahath.
    In Joshua's list someone named a son after the famous Ephraimite clan
    leader, Tahan, so when reconstructing Joshua's list, both Tahans must be
    included. The Caleb list contains two famous Calebs born 400 years apart.
    Published lists that fail to recognize any one of these five duplications
    raise questions about the inerrancy of Scripture. So these lists are very
    important, not only for the historical data they preserve, but also for
    their contribution to the integrity of Scripture.

I Chronicles 2:5, 9-15. (Underlining
    ours.)
</p>
<p>
    David's list spans both the Egyptian sojourn and period of the Judges. Our
    final four examples following David focus on the line of Aaron and
    Levitical service in the tabernacle that covered the period of the Judges.
    Because of the familiarity of certain names in David's ancestry, Hebrew
    practice could reduce it to just a handful. Of all the names in this list,
    the most familiar was that of David himself, Israel's most famous and
    beloved king, born about 1040 BC. Another was Nahshon, Prince of Judah, at
    the time of the Exodus. Yet another was Boaz, the kinsman-redeemer, who
    brought the Moabitess Ruth into the line of Christ, a story celebrated in
    the book bearing her name. Perez, the first in David's list, was founder of
    the most illustrious clan of Judah. He was born about the time Israel moved
    to Egypt-1876 BC.
</p>
<p>
    These are four of the ten names in David's line. The ten span an astounding
    836 years. At the rate of four generations per century a complete list
    might contain as many as 33 names! Due to adjustments for known
    circumstances, we reduce this number to 30 names in all, of which 20 are
    omitted. This list of exactly ten names is found in Ruth chapter four. It
    can be followed within the longer list of I Chronicles two. The names in
    these two lists leading to David are identical and in the same order,
    starting with Perez and concluding with David. They are repeated without
    change in the lists of Matthew and Luke. This highly abbreviated list was
    efficient. It produced a pleasing effect and it made the story flow. It was
    characteristically Hebrew.
</p>
<p>
    Before looking at the details, a word about the rest of this chapter: still
    to come are four more examples of abbreviated genealogies- the priesthood,
    Ezra and the temple singers-15 examples in all. To further develop the
    subject, three additional lines and five side-by-side tables are
    introduced. To avoid confusion, the same numbers assigned in the Appendix
    are used here. So, 15 of the 22 tables are separate examples of condensed
    genealogies. The first side-by-side table contains the lists of David and
    Jerahmeel. Starting with Perez David's list has six names while Jerahmeel
    has 23 for the same time frame. The side-by-side tables both visualize
    omitted generations and provide double checking.
</p>
<h4>
    Three Groups Separated by Hundreds of Years
</h4>
<p>
    Upon examining David's list more carefully it is grouped around three
    periods of Hebrew history-three names at the beginning of the Egyptian
    sojourn, three names at the time of the Exodus 430-years later, and four
    names concluding with David's day 400 years after that. Those three groups
    of names were commonly known to be in a single line of descent, so there
    was no need to include all the omitted names since the purpose of Hebrew
    genealogies was identifying ancestry, not proving it.
</p>
<p>
    The first group should have started with Judah, and the longer lists do
    include him. But in Ruth the list starts with Perez. The name "Perez",
    Judah's fourth son, was almost synonymous with the name "Judah." From Perez
    came not only the bulk of the tribe's population but its kings, Bezelel the
    chief Temple artist, Caleb the spy and, most importantly, the promised
    Messiah. By beginning with Perez, the list in Ruth presents exactly ten
    names, a deliberate design which further indicates that it was abbreviated.
    From Perez the line of David went through his son Hezron and Hezron's
    second son Ram. Hezron was Perez's oldest son, so if typical he would have
    been born 25 years after his father. Thus, Hezron's second son, Ram would
    have been born about 29 years after his father (boy, girl, boy, girl;
    spaced two years apart). This places the births of Hezron and Ram at about
    1851 BC and 1822 BC.
</p>
<p>
    The second group (Amminadab-Nahshon-Salmon) centers around Nahshon, the
    famous Prince of Judah who supervised the census for his tribe at the time
    of the Exodus (Numbers 1). Aaron married a sister of Nahshon. The father of
    these important people, Amminadab, was a household name in Israel. Aaron
    was 84 at the time of the census so his wife was possibly 10-15 years
    younger or 67-74. Most likely she was an older sister of Nahshon. This
    would make Amminadab 95-100 years at the time of the census, placing his
    birth somewhere around 1540 BC. Since about 280 years passed between the
    birth of Ram, the last person in the first group, and the birth of
    Amminadab, the first person in the second group (1822-1540=282), Ram is the
    only person available to span these nearly three centuries. On the basis of
    four generations per century, eleven generations are missing between Ram
    and Amminadab.
</p>
<p>
    This second set of three names concludes with Salmon. Matthew identifies
    Salmon as a member of this group when he states "Salmon the father of Boaz
    by Rahab..." (Matthew 1:5). Scriptures covering that period do not speak of
    Salmon's marriage or even Salmon, so apart from Matthew his place in the
    time frame between Nahshon and Boaz would be unknown. But the clue is found
    in Matthew's reference to Rahab, the famous resident of Jericho at the time
    of the Hebrew invasion in 1406 BC who hid the two spies. As a reward they
    promised that her family would be spared in the coming Hebrew conquest. A
    son of Nahshon by the name of Salmon married her, continuing the line of
    Perez to David. Many commentators conclude Salmon was one of the two
    unnamed spies.
</p>
<p>
    How do the numbers work out? Salmon would have been under military age at
    the time when the ten spies brought back the bad report and God sentenced
    Israel to a year in the wilderness for every day the spies searched Canaan.
    With Amminadab at an estimated 95 and Nahshon at 65 this would place Salmon
    at the age of 40 when Israel captured and destroyed Jericho. That military
    victory was in 1406 BC, 40 years after the Exodus. The events somewhat
    dictate the ages of those three men.
</p>
<p>
    The 1446 BC Exodus date affords an ideal point to estimate the ages of the
    principals in this second group. Ten of the 12 spies shortly after the
    Exodus returned a bad report. They were around the age of 40. Apparently
    Joshua decided to send more mature spies in 1406 BC-those around 50 or 55.
    This would place Salmon's birth about 1456-1461 BC, ten or fifteen years
    before the Exodus. As stated above Amminadab was about 90 then. Aaron was
    83 (Exodus 7:7). His wife (Nahshon's older sister-Elisheba) would have been
    around 65. This would make Nahshon about 60 and further confirm Salmon's
    age at about 10 or 15.
</p>
<p>
    As to Rahab's age when she hid the spies, she had a considerable reputation
    and an extensive family as well; so she also must have been older, possibly
    even in her forties, about ten years younger than Salmon. Since Boaz lived
    hundreds of years later, when Scripture says Salmon fathered Boaz, it is
    using the term "fathered" in the broad sense of being the forefather of
    Boaz. Two hundred eighty-two years passed between the birth of the last
    father in the first group and the first father in the second group. Now we
    find a second large gap between the second and third group of fathers. Next
    we will determine how many years elapsed between Salmon who was born about
    1456 BC and Boaz who lived near the time of David.
</p>
<p>
    The final group in this list contains four generations
    (Boaz-Obed-Jesse-David). These are immediate father-son relationships.
</p>
<p>
    The women of the neighborhood gave him [the child of Boaz and Ruth] a name,
    saying, 'A son has been born to Naomi.' They named him Obed. He was the
    father of Jesse, the father of David. Ruth 4:17.
</p>
<p>
    David was born about 1040 BC. Since he was the youngest of eight sons, his
    father would have been born about 1080 BC. The birth of Obed would have
    been c. 25 years earlier, about 1105 BC. Boaz was older when he married
    Ruth, possibly 60, so c. 1165 B.C. would mark his birth. Salmon, the last
    father in the previous group, was born about 1461-1456 BC; so, 300 years
    passed between the births of Salmon and Boaz. Our standard rate for new
    generations suggests twelve generations should have occurred during this
    period. Adjusting for the late start of families can account for several of
    these generations, but at least nine are omitted. Added to the eleven
    generations omitted between the first and second group, about 20
    generations are omitted in this list from Perez to David. Each of the ten
    names in the list had an important place in Hebrew history. Most likely the
    other 20 were relatively unknown. This is classic Hebrew genealogy. It
    appears without alteration in Matthew and Luke.
</p>
<p>
    Since some may suggest that Scripture gives many examples of starting
    generations late, we would be the first to acknowledge such examples.
    However, they are exceptions, not the rule. As soon as the difficulty was
    removed, the normal pattern took over. Jacob delayed taking a wife when he
    saw the distress of his parents over Esau's two Canaanite wives. He was 81
    when God gave him a wife, and in the next ten years he had twelve children
    (by four wives). On the other hand Arphachshad, the first named person
    after the Flood, and the next six generations each started having sons
    between the ages of twenty-nine and thirty-five. That was normal then.
</p>
<p>
    Abraham's father began his family at the age of 70, but we know the
    reason-infertility. Infertility was an intermittent problem in Terah's
    line. His daughter, Sarah, was infertile, having a child by the direct
    intervention of God at the age of ninety. Rebekah, granddaughter of Terah,
    was infertile and had twins by the direct intervention of God when Isaac
    was sixty. All of this was abnormal. When Jacob moved his family to Egypt,
    his twelve sons were between the ages of 48 and 24. All of them had sons.
    Some even appear to have had grandsons. Joseph, who died at the age of 110,
    saw his descendants to the fourth generation (Genesis 50:23). Starting
    families between the ages of 18 and early thirties was typical of Hebrew
    culture after Jacob.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 12 Details-The Priesthood of Israel. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The priesthood upheld the heart of the nation. God called it to a unique
    and formidable mission. Unique-tasked to teach the nation God's holiness,
    the essence and acts of sin and sin's necessary absolution through
    sacrifice. Formidable-the nation's very relationship with God depended upon
    keeping His laws. Underlying that relationship were promises within a
    covenant which were repeated and enhanced. Thus, the genealogies of the
    Priesthood were foundational to the very survival of the nation.
</p>
<p>
    God chose this special line when the Hebrews numbered several million and
    the adult males among them numbered about eight hundred thousand. From them
    God chose just one man, Aaron, and his four sons to become the officials
    assigned with keeping the nation true to God. His two oldest sons taught,
    by bad example, that to violate God's instructions for worship could be
    lethal. They offered strange fire and God slew them. The two remaining
    sons, Eleazar and Ithamar and their descendants alone would be the nation's
    priests.
</p>
<p>
    Numbers 18:7 cites the divine authorization for this hereditary priesthood.
    To Aaron God said: "You and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood
    for all that concerns the altar and that is within the veil; and you shall
    serve. I give your priesthood as a gift, and any outsider who comes near
    shall be put to death." Encroaching on the priesthood was no small offense.
    It triggered a death penalty. The priesthood particularly involved "the
    altar and what was within the veil." To assist Aaron in all the work
    associated with the exacting demands of the Tabernacle operations, all the
    rest of the tribe of Levi, some 22,000 males, was a gift to him "to do the
    service of the tent of meeting" (Numbers 18:6). In the beginning the
    priesthood of Israel was indeed selective.
</p>
<p>
    Levi's three sons-Gershon, Kohath and Merari-gave the tribe its three
    clans. They camped on three sides of the Tabernacle while Moses and Aaron
    tented on the entrance side which faced east. Levites of retirement age
    were to guard the Tabernacle, forbidding unauthorized access and putting to
    death any who violated its sacredness. Whether they ever executed anyone or
    not, their very presence assured a proper respect for the Tabernacle. This
    institution (priest, Tabernacle, sacrifice and Ark) enforced God's rule as
    He dwelt at the very center of the nation. He was the very cause and reason
    for Israel's existence. To weaken this institution was like making war on
    God who uniquely established the nation. Therefore, trifling with the
    Tabernacle would be a most capital offense.
</p>
<p>
    Numbers 3:4 relates that "Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the
lifetime of Aaron their father." Just before Aaron died God told Moses,    <sup>25</sup>"Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount
    Hor. <sup>26</sup>And strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar
    his son. <sup>27</sup>And Aaron shall be gathered to his people and shall
    die there" (Numbers 20:25-27). While all the descendants of Aaron who met
    the qualifications could serve as priests, only one would wear the special
    garment of high priest.
</p>
<p>
    A short time later Israel began whoring with the daughters of Moab (Numbers
    25:1). God said to hang the chiefs of the people to stop the plague He had
    sent. Moses ordered the judges to slay the guilty under them. Phinehas,
    grandson of Aaron and son of Eleazar, took a spear and plunged it through a
    prominent Israelite man and noted Moabite woman in the man's bedchamber.
    God said the zeal of Phinehas had turned back His anger from consuming the
    nation even though the plague took 24,000. As a reward God said:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    Behold, I give to him [Phinehas] my covenant of peace, <sup>13</sup>and it
    shall be to him and to his descendants after him the covenant of a
    perpetual priesthood, because he was jealous for his God and made atonement
    for the people of Israel. Numbers 25:12-13.
</p>
<p>
    This event further refined the official line of high priests in Israel.
    While all of Aaron's descendants qualified genealogically as priests, God
    appointed Aaron's older surviving son Eleazar to be Aaron's successor; and,
    this verse arranged that the position of chief priest would be given to
    Eleazar's son Phinehas and his line. The next chief priests were all direct
    descendants of Phinehas.
</p>
<h4>
    Switching from the Line of Eleazar to the Line of Ithamar: Meet the High
    Priest Eli
</h4>
<p>
    Then for some unexplained reason the work of high priest switched from a
    descendant of Aaron's older son Eleazar to a descendant of his younger son
    Ithamar. How strange, in view of the covenant given to Phinehas. Since
    service at the Tabernacle was essential for the accomplishment of God's
    purpose with Israel, commentators have surmised that some unusual
    circumstance led to the necessity of calling on Ithamar's line, such as the
    existing chief priest becoming incapacitated, or the next in line being
    just an infant, or the demands of being both a chief priest and judge being
    too great for the next priest in line at that time.
</p>
<p>
    Whatever circumstance led to calling on the line of Ithamar, the elders of
    Israel must have sought the LORD, and He designated Eli of the line of
    Ithamar. Almost unanimously commentators agree that Eli was the legitimate
    acting chief priest. However, the official record of I Chronicles six does
    not mention him. As far as can be determined it only lists direct
    descendants of Eleazar through Phinehas. The equivalent of five generations
    from the line of Eli served as high priest for well over a century. After
    that the position reverted to the descendants of Aaron's older son Eleazar.
    While this switch was strange, the overriding principle was that God needed
    faithful priests. In His sovereign choice, He raised up the line of Eli who
    filled that need for a time. Although his two sons were worthless men,
    without question, his grandson Ahitub, and the following two generations
    were godly men and faithful chief priests.
</p>
<p>
    Saul wiped out 84 priests of Eli's descendants wearing the ephod at Nob (I
    Samuel 22:6-23). One alone, Abiathar, escaped to David and served under him
    as David continued to elude Saul. Abiathar came with an ephod (I Samuel
    23:6) which allowed David to inquire of the LORD. Through Abiathar and his
    ephod the LORD gave specific instructions concerning David's efforts to
    avoid being killed by Saul (I Samuel 23:2, 4, 9-12). With all but one of
    the priests who descended from Eli dead and that sole surviving priest
    being with the fugitive David, Israel had no functioning priesthood.
    Scripture does not tell how, but descendants of Eleazar again began serving
    as priests for the rest of the nation. So, for a period, two high priests
    served, one with David from the family of Ithamar and one with the nation
    at Gibeon from the family of Eleazar.
</p>
<p>
    Near the end of David's life, the priest with David (Abiathar of the
    Ithamar line) supported Adonijah, David's son who was born next after
    Absalom and unwisely declared himself as David's successor when David was
    bedridden. By that time Zadok of the line of Eleazar was backing David.
    After David made Solomon king, Solomon retired Abiathar; but his son
    Jonathan, and later grandson Ahimelech served as head of the eight courses
    of priests made up from the Ithamar line.
</p>
<h4>
    Why Didn't Samuel Succeed Eli as High Priest?
</h4>
<p>
    If the case of Eli was unusual, the case of Samuel was doubly so. Most
    Bible students know that Eli's sons were wicked, even fornicating with
    female servants at the Tabernacle. Scripture calls them worthless and said
    they blasphemed the sacrifices of the LORD. Their debauchery was a national
    scandal. Samuel's mother, who was barren, saw the need for a faithful
    priest at Shiloh and vowed that if the LORD gave her a son, she would
    dedicate him to serve God all his life. Hannah and her husband Elkanah were
    descendants of Levi, serving the tribe of Ephraim and thus called
    "Ephrathites" (I Samuel 1:1). As Levites they were very concerned for the
    spiritual welfare of Israel. But Elkanah was not a descendant of Aaron so
    he was not a priest. God gave Hannah the son she prayed for; and, once he
    was weaned she left him with Eli. Her prayer of praise in I Samuel 2
    contains images of her expectations that God would triumph over evil
    through righteous servants.
</p>
<p>
    Through the years Eli found Samuel to be all that his sons were not and
    trained Samuel to perform the duties of a priest. Meanwhile God began to
    give visions to Samuel so that in time all Israel knew that God spoke
    through him. Then came the day when Eli's sons carried the ark into battle
    against the Philistines who defeated the Israelites, captured the ark and
    killed Eli's two sons. When the news reached Eli he fell over backwards and
    died of a broken neck. He was 98 years old. His two wicked sons were most
    likely in their sixties and his oldest grandchildren could have been over
    30. One was actually born that day.
</p>
<p>
    We might expect Samuel, who by this time was about 30, to step into the
    role of chief priest but he did not. In fact, he did not call himself a
    priest and Scripture never calls him a priest. This is amazing since he
    wore the ephod, the priests' garment, and Scripture says repeatedly that he
    "ministered unto the LORD under Eli." How can this be explained? The answer
    is twofold-first his genealogy but second God's purposes. Samuel was not a
    descendant of Aaron. While he was a Levite, he could never be the high
    priest or even hold the office of priest because he was not a son of Aaron.
    As a Levite he could assist Eli in any way Eli asked, but on his own
    authority, he could not offer sacrifice at the Tabernacle. He knew his
    genealogy and honored God by somehow avoiding the designation of priest. In
    fact he must have made this clear to his contemporaries because the title
    "priest" is never given to him in Scripture. This remarkable dedication in
    itself is an evidence of the inerrancy of Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    But secondly, a man of God came to Eli even before Samuel's call when he
    was still very young. After rehearsing the wickedness of Eli's sons, he
    said, <sup>30</sup>"The God of Israel declares 'I promised that your house
    and the house of your father should go in and out before me forever,' but
    now the LORD declares: 'Far be it from me, for those who honor me I will
    honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed. <sup>31</sup>
    Behold, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the
    strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in
    your house" (I Samuel 2:31-32). Then comes the principle basic to any
    blessing from God: "I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall
    do according to what is in my heart and in my mind" (I Samuel 2:35).
    Implicit in enjoying any promised blessing of God is a heart submitted to
    His will.
</p>
<p>
    This explains how Samuel could "minister unto the LORD" yet not officially
    be a priest. Above all, God honors and receives the service of faithful
    servants. But the story is not done. I Chronicles 9:22 gives Samuel credit
    along with David for organizing activities at the Tabernacle. Apparently
    when Eli and his sons died on the same day, the fear of the LORD gripped
    Eli's remaining descendants and, if not before, they became very humble and
    teachable. Samuel began a training program for Eli's grandsons and over the
    years both organized and standardized the priestly services at the
    Tabernacle so that Eli's next three generations all served faithfully as
    priests. Possibly Samuel did this through his office as the last judge of
    Israel. Regardless, the intent of his mother's prayer, that righteousness
    would prevail, was answered.
</p>
<p>
    We know Samuel's genealogy because David appointed his grandson, Heman, to
    be the chief choirmaster at the Tabernacle. His apparently complete
    genealogy beginning with Korah (Table 5.2) is given in the Chronicles
    chapter (I Chronicles 6) devoted to Levi's descendants. Genealogies were an
    essential feature to the success of Israel in accomplishing God's purposes
    with the nation. Godly Israelites such as Samuel held the genealogies as
    the very word and will of God.
</p>
<h4>
    Other Characteristics of Israel's High Priests
</h4>
<p>
    The succession of high priests is not a reliable way to measure the passing
    of time. Whereas generations were measured from the birth of the father to
    the birth of his first son, the office of high priest was just the
    opposite. When the high priest died or became extremely disabled, his son
    assumed the office. (The same was true for Israel's kings.) So in the case
    of the chief priest, time would be measured from the death of one to the
    death of the next.
</p>
<p>
    While on first glance this seams reliable; in fact, it is not. In the case
    of Eli, when he died at the age of 98 he was blind (I Samuel 4:15). His
    sons (and Samuel) had been doing the work of the high priest but neither of
    them held the office. Eli's sons actually died before their father died and
    Eli's grandson succeeded Eli as the next chief priest. In the case of
    Israel's first high priest, Aaron, it seems that his sons, Eleazar and
    Ithamar, were doing most of the work in Aaron's later years. In the next
    generation Phinehas was very active while his father Eleazar was still
    alive and held the office.
</p>
<p>
    The practice of naming sons after famous forefathers was commonly practiced
    by Israel's later high priests. In the list of 23 names of I Chronicles 6,
    there are three duplicates (Amariah, Ahitub and Zadak) and one triplicate
    (Azariah). Eli also followed this practice by naming his second son after
    Aaron's famous grandson Phinehas. His line also first used the name Ahitub
    which the official line would later use twice. The Chronicles list also
    begins with Jacob, Levi, Kohath and Amram before naming Aaron, Israel's
    first high priest. That mentioning is an example of condensing because
    there are up to twelve unnamed generations between Amram and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    As to the completeness of the Chronicles list, Dr. Keil writes: "We find
    too few names for the time from the death of Aaron to the death of Uzzi
    (Ozi), when Eli became high priest-a period of 299 years [by the
    Keil/Delitzsche chronology]&#8230;. Five high priests-Eleazar, Phinehas,
    Abishua, Bukki and Uzzi-are too few; for in that case each one of them must
    have discharged the office for 60 years, and have begotten the son who
    succeeded him in the office only in his 60<sup>th</sup> year, or the
    grandson must have regularly succeeded the grandfather in the office-all of
    which suppositions appear somewhat incredible. Clearly, therefore,
    intermediate names must have been omitted in our register."
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Keil finds the second and third periods (Eli-Solomon and Solomon to the
    Captivity) to have about the right number of names, serving an average of
    25-35 years. He adds that notable names such as Jehoiada and Urijah "who
    was certainly high priest (2 Kings 16:10 ff)" are omitted, but that some
    like Jehoiada might have been known by another name in the Chronicles list
and that Urijah was too unimportant to be included.    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Remarkably, in the days of King Joash, Jehoiada was the only priest
    mentioned from the time he and his wife hid baby Joash until his death late
    in Joash's reign. Jehoiada died at the remarkable age of 130 (2 Chronicles
    24:15). His career was so distinguished that he was buried among the kings
    of Israel. The period from the birth of Joash until the death of Johoiada
    late in the king's career suggests he was about 90 years old when he is
    first mentioned in Scripture. Certainly his outstanding service to the LORD
    had gone on for many years before Joash. He was the face of the priesthood
    for 50-60 years, yet his name is not found in either the I Chronicles 6 or
    Ezra lists. Either his name was dropped from the list by scribal error or
    he was such an effective priest that even if one or more chief priests in
    the list ruled during his years of stellar service, they let him represent
    them.
</p>
<p>
    With a few exceptions, the abbreviation of genealogies during the period
    following David is beyond the scope of this study. This survey of the high
    priestly line is for the purpose of exploring the possibility of omitted
    chief priests while guiding readers away from unfounded interpretations. On
    the other hand, Table 6.14 shows a definite gap in the line of Ezra the
    priest when placed side by side with the Chronicles list of high priests.
    The observations of Dr. Keil together with our comments on Jehoiada seem to
    establish a reasonable possibility that even the line of high priests
    followed the principle of selectivity in the records when it could. On the
    basis of 30 year tenures we have entered five successive omissions in the
    first period as well as several individuals during the second period. But,
    most importantly, the high priestly office was a matter of heredity; so,
    where the correct name was essential there would be no condensing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Example 13 Details-Ezra the Priest. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <sup>1</sup>
    Now after this in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of
    Seraiah, the son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, <sup>2</sup>son of Shallum,
    son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, <sup>3</sup>son of Amariah, son of Azariah, [I
    Chronicles 6:9-7 adds "Johanah, Azariah, Ahimaaz, Zadok, Ahitub and
    Amariah"], son of Meraioth, <sup>4</sup>son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son
    of Bukki, <sup>5</sup>son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son
    of Aaron the chief priest&#8230;. Ezra 7:1-5.
</p>
<p>
    Spanning from Aaron to the post-Exile period, Ezra's genealogy, like
    David's, is clearly abbreviated. It omits six consecutive chief priests
    that are found in the primary record of Aaron's line (I Chronicles 6:1-15).
    The omission occurred around the transition from the Judges to the
    monarchy. Many think Ezra compiled I Chronicles. Whether or not he did the
    fact that he is closely identified with I Chronicles shows he was very
    familiar with that record so his omission was clearly intentional.
</p>
<p>
    In Ezra 7:1-5 Ezra listed his descent all the way back to Aaron, Israel's
    first chief priest. He began, "Ezra the son of Seraiah" and used the same
    phrase "the son of" or "son of" with each head priest until he reached
    Aaron. From Seraiah to Aaron he listed 16 forefathers. One has no clue that
    his genealogy is condensed except that in I Chronicles 6:1-15 the same list
    is given in the opposite order and contains 22 names from Aaron to Seraiah.
    The six names Ezra omits are not an occasional omission here and there,
    which might then be the result of scribal error, but are the six
    consecutive high priests that are named between Azariah and Meraioth. The
    six omitted priests working back from Azariah are 1-Johannan, 2-Azariah, 3-
    Ahimaaz, 4-Zadok, 5-Ahitub and 6-Amariah. After passing over those six
    consecutive high priests, Ezra continued with "son of Meraioth, son of
    Zerahiah" etc. (See both lists side by side in Table 6.13.)
</p>
<p>
    Viewing the list of high priests found in I Chronicles 6:1-15 in descending
order (beginning with Aaron), the six missing priests are the 9    <sup>th</sup> through the 14<sup>th</sup>
    (Amariah-Ahitub-Zadok-Ahimaaz-Azariah-Johanan). Ezra may have abbreviated
    the list of 22 into 16 for sake of brevity, but then again, there may have
    been a deeper reason for omitting the six names.
</p>
<p>
    If Ezra were uncertain about who was really the chief priest during that
    time of two chief priests, perhaps he bypassed the problem by condensing
    his genealogy to avoid stating chief priests who functioned as chief
    priests but did not officially hold the office of chief priest. Then when
    the list in Chronicles was put together, the author(s) decided on recording
    a clear line from Eleazar. While this explanation is tentative and does not
    explain why those omitted extended beyond the end of Eli's line, whatever
    was the reason for omitting six consecutive priests, it is clear that Ezra
    did omit them and that this instance adds to the many examples showing that
    abbreviating lists was acceptable in Hebrew thinking.
</p>
<p>
    Ezra also omitted the generations between Seraiah and him. Nebuchadnezzar
    slew his elderly forefather Seraiah. Seraiah's successor, Jehozadak, was
    the high priest during the captivity and presumably Seraiah's oldest son.
    Jehozadak was followed by his son Jeshua who was the first high priest when
    Cyrus the Great decreed that captives could return to their land. Then,
    Scripture names six succeeding high priests. Possibly Ezra does not name
    them because he was a descendant of one of the other sons of Seraiah. All
    he needed to do was show that he descended from Aaron which qualified him
    as a priest so he omits the obscure names between Seraiah and himself.
    Table 13 shows Ezra's list side by side with Aaron's.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Examples 14-16 Details-The Temple Singers. </strong>
    King David appointed a descendant from each Levite clan to lead
    worship-Heman from the clan of Kohath (but not a son of Amram-I Chronicles
    6:33 with 6:38), Asaph from the clan of Gershom (I Chronicles 6:39, 43) and
    Ethan from the clan of Merari (I Chronicles 6:44). None of these men were
    descendants of Aaron so none qualified for the office of priest. But all
    the descendants of Levi were given to Aaron to assist him in leading Israel
    in worship and all three were Levites. Samuel's grandson Heman, the chief
    choirmaster, descended from Izhar through Korah the rebel (Tables 5.1 and
    6.14).
</p>
<p>
    Nineteen generations are found beginning with Korah and ending with Heman.
    In the same time period the line of Aaron, contemporary with Korah, names
    but eleven. We suggest about 26 years per generation in Heman's line, but
    30 years per generation in Aaron's line and include nine omissions to make
    the dates work for Aaron. Heman had 14 sons in his choir (maybe sons and
    grandsons) so he was most likely older than David. Like Aaron's line
    Asaph's line is also condensed. It has twelve names, skipping about seven.
    Ethan's line is even more condensed, containing just ten, thus skipping
    about nine generations.
</p>
<p>
    These three lines span the very important years of Israel's early history,
    about 500 years from Aaron to David. To picture the distribution of these
    generations Table 6.11b shows them side by side with David and Table 6.15a
    shows them side by side with Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Final example of abbreviated genealogies, example 16 Details-Heman
    </strong>
    . David appointed this grandson of Samuel to the position of chief
    Tabernacle choir master. His list is recorded in the chapter on Levite
    genealogies, I Chronicles 6. It begins with him in verse 33 and goes all
    the way back to the Patriarch Israel in verse 39. In a way it follows the
    pattern of the first seven examples, giving tribe, clan, household and
    individual, adding only the name Israel. The individual following an
    approximately 12 generation gap is Korah (Table 6.02). But from Korah to
    Heman are 19 names. That calculates to 26+ year generations so that part of
    the list is most likely complete.
</p>
<p>
    The remarkable genealogy of Samuel (Table 6.17) concludes this series of
    lists. Words fail to describe the ministry of this godly man in the
    spiritual life of Israel. Following his genealogy is a supporting
    chronology (Table 6.17a) while Table 17b places his list side by side with
    that of Aaron and Eli. Because of so many ties with other lists, his list
    is a delightful conclusion to this very detailed chapter on lists. While
    many of the date assignments are estimates, they must be close to the true
    dates because of so many complementary lists.
</p>
<h4>
    <a name="_Hlk92533240">Summary on Condensed Genealogies</a>
</h4>
<p>
    This chapter has presented a case for the condensing of numerous
    genealogies-those of Aaron, Korah, Dathan, Abiram, On, Achan, the daughters
    of Zelophehad, Sheerah, Joshua, Caleb the spy, David, the priesthood of
    Israel, Ezra, two Temple singers and Heman. Among the most obvious are
    Aaron (Table 6.01), Ezra (Table 6.14) and David (Table 6.11). The case of
    Ezra is both straight forward and simple because when comparing his list
    with the official list in Chronicles, he omits six consecutive names. Since
    it is understood that Ezra the Scribe was heavily involved in editing books
    of the Old Testament and he wrote the book of Ezra, he was at the least
    very familiar with I Chronicles. This seems to be another iron-clad example
    of an abbreviated genealogy.
</p>
<p>
    The case of Aaron is the iron-clad example we used to unlock this subject
    in chapter one; however, it requires far more detail to establish than the
    block of omissions in Ezra's line. But numerous other examples have been
    presented. While a few may legitimately be dismissed through alternative
    interpretations, most will remain. Consequently, those of faith have two
    duties-both to receive the text of Scripture as the very word of God and to
    understand it in the light of how words were used when the text was
    written. The great encouragement section of Isaiah begins with a reminder
    that while all flesh is grass, "the word of our God will stand forever"
    (Isaiah 40:6, 8). Our poor minds must defer to that which stands throughout
    eternity.
</p>
<p>
    While recognizing that the above abbreviated genealogies, at most, make
    only a difference of 215-years in the date of creation, they do establish a
    precedent for Hebrew genealogies commonly being condensed. If the
    genealogies of Genesis 5 and/or 11 bear evidence of condensing, they could
    change the date of the Flood by much more than 215-years. They will be
    looked at in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Confirmation of the biblical use of genealogies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the summer of 2021, I stumbled across an article on the Internet that
    contained the same information I had discovered from Scripture over the
    preceding decade and have written in this chapter and the last. The article
    WAs entitled "The Genesis Genealogies" and first appeared in the 1/1/2001
    newsletter of <em>Reasons to Believe</em>. It was comprehensive,
    well-organized and the writer, Dr. John M. Millam, was a chemist in his
    mid-thirties. Thus, two individuals of totally different backgrounds but
    the same love for Jesus Christ and belief in the inerrancy of Scripture
    conclude that Scripture uses family terms in the broad sense as well as the
    immediate sense and that it often abbreviates OT genealogies. The agreement
    of such diverse researchers surely argues for the soundness of this view.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk92644064">In 2011 Dr. Millam </a>
    updated his article. Now as a 38-page pdf file, it answers to an Internet
    search for "The Genesis Genealogies." In personal correspondence he told me
    the biblical history bug bit him and it has become his passion. Over the
    last 20 years he has written about 19 articles for the bimonthly
    newsletter. He is especially precise in showing how many of those who argue
    for the young earth position are inexact in their research. We agree with
    him on this point and seek to approach Scripture with all the integrity we
    can muster. In chapter eight we will answer his position on the extent of
    the Flood and duration of the days of creation but these different views
    must not divide the body of Christ.

<h4>
    Secular History of the Ancient Near East Confirm Biblical Records
</h4>
<p>
    Chapters 1-6 of <em>HB</em> discuss the biblical records from Abraham to
    Moses. By giving many numbers including the years of the Patriarchs and the
    life of Moses, Bible students can date the birth of Abraham to 2166 BC, the
    beginning of the sojourn in Egypt to 1876 BC and the Exodus to 1446 BC.
    These dates fit well with secular history, thus adding confirmation to the
    validity of Scripture. Abraham left Ur and entered Canaan at exactly the
    only time when Southern Persia briefly dominated Mesopotamia until 1500
    years later. During this stretch of history Moses lived precisely when
    Egyptian history could allow it even though all traces of Israel's time in
    Egypt have been erased.
</p>
<p>
    The Pharaoh of Joseph's day gave Jacob's family choice land in the Nile
    Delta. Later, Hyksos invaders overcame weak pharaohs and gained control of
    parts of Lower Egypt. This allowed the Hebrews considerable freedom since
    both peoples were semitic. Some Egyptologist go so far as to say that the
    Hebrews were allies of the Hyksos. Scripture doesn't speak of the Hyksos
    but does report that Jacob's descendants multiplied until "the land was
    filled with them" (Exodus 1:7). Verse eleven reports that a pharaoh set
    task masters over them to afflict them "lest they join our
    enemies&#8230;and escape from the land".
</p>
<p>
    Even slavery did not stop Hebrew population growth. So a new policy was
    issued: the Hebrew midwives were instructed to kill Hebrew boy babies. When
    that didn't work Pharaoh gave the order to cast Hebrew boy babies into the
    Nile River. Moses was born at this time. His mother hid him as long as she
    could (three months; Exodus 2:2), then cleverly prepared a floating basket,
    put her baby inside and placed the basket where Pharaoh's daughter bathed
    each day. Pharaoh's daughter spotted the basket, looked inside and saw a
    baby boy crying. Scripture says she took pity on him even though she
    recognized immediately that the baby was a Hebrew.
</p>
<p>
    The baby's sister had been stationed to watch. She offered to get a Hebrew
    nurse. Pharaoh's daughter agreed, the baby's mother came and Pharaoh's
    daughter said "Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give
    you your wages" (Exodus 2:9). When the child grew older, his mother brought
    him to Pharaoh's daughter. Because of this remarkable window of
    opportunity, one can only imagine how intensely his family worked to
    prepare him to live as one of their own in Pharaoh's palace. Also of
    importance, Thutmose I would have had to give his daughter permission to
    adopt a Hebrew as her own son so he had reasons for giving this permission
    and they are open to no end of speculation.
</p>
<p>
As to Egyptian history, Amenhotep I was the first pharaoh of the 18    <sup>th</sup> Dynasty and is credited with driving out the Hyksos so he
    would have been the pharaoh who enslaved the Hebrews. The next Pharaoh,
    Thutmose I, followed the policies of his predecessor, oppressing the
    Hebrews. He also expanded the empire into Nubia and penetrated deep into
    Syria. He fathered a daughter named Hatshepsut by his royal wife and later
    a son, Thutmose II, by a secondary wife. Thutmose II married his older
    half-sister and they had one child, a daughter named Neferure. Thutmose II
    also fathered a son, Thutmose III, by a lesser wife. Then he died, leaving
    Egypt with a two-year-old pharaoh.
</p>
<p>
    Historians use an astronomical event to date the years of Thutmose III. But
    it has a major problem. Where it was observed was unrecorded, so it varies
    by 20 years depending on whether it was observed from the Delta or up the
    Nile at Thebes. Instead of Thutmose III ruling Egypt through an appointed
    stand in, Hatshepsut, his aunt, governed the country on her own. Thutmose
    III did not take the reins of power until Hatshepsut died 20 years later.
    History has concluded he hated her and, in his resentment, did all in his
    power to erase her name once he was in charge. In the last few years
    Egyptologist have changed this view. They have enough reasons to write a
    book but we only have a page to pass on their thinking.
</p>
<p>
    Amenhotep II, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, not his father Thutmose III, was
    the Pharaoh who took credit for some of Hatshepsut's accomplishments. It is
    speculated that he did this to strengthen his claim to the throne. This
    indicates that he was a weak pharaoh. He was the Pharaoh of the Exodus.
    Thutmose III actually built his tomb adjacent to that of Hatshepsut who
    ruled for him until he was 22. Most likely, she did all she could to
    prepare him for a successful life as Pharaoh when he was ready. He
    certainly moved forward, building on her prosperous reign, not complaining
    about the past once he was in charge.
</p>
<p>
    History regards Thutmose II as an insignificant pharaoh. Only a small
    number of documents exist for his reign. Relief scenes during his reign
    depict both him with his wife and his wife alone. Only one major monument
    is credited to Thutmose II and that one was completed by his son. Unique
    scarab seals were used by each Pharaoh on official documents and other
    important works. Because they were extremely small, they were hard to
    alter. The number for each Pharaoh is considered indicative of that
    Pharaoh's importance. Archaeologists have found 241 for Thutmose I, 65 for
    Thutmose II and 463 for Hatshepsut.
</p>
<p>
    Hatshepsut was a prolific builder, commissioning hundreds of construction
    projects including the Twin Obelisks, the tallest in the world at the time.
    She employed the world-famous architect, Ineni. She produced prodigious
    amounts of statuary. She worked on increasing trade and generally conducted
    a peaceful rule. Egypt became prosperous under her hand. Whether it was a
    baby boy or a nation, her instinct was to nurture, to give the best care
    possible.
</p>
<p>
    For years scholars debated whether she regarded herself as Pharaoh. Now
    they are certain she did, making her the 2<sup>nd</sup> confirmed female
    pharaoh in Egyptian history. In fact, she claimed her father intended that
    she should succeed him. It is thought that she even acted as her father's
    regent in his final years, was the power behind her husband's entire rule
    as well as those first 20 years of Thutmose III's rule. These years are
    characterized by consistent domestic and foreign policies. When she did
    die, due to the prosperity she left, Thutmose III could begin the first of
    16 military campaigns that over 20 years would extend Egypt's power all the
    way to the Euphrates. He is considered a military genius and was one of the
    most militaristic of all the Pharaohs. One historian called him the
    Napoleon of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Where is Moses in all this? Moses wrote in Exodus 2:10 that when the Hebrew
    nurse brought the child to "Pharaoh's daughter&#8230;he became her son. She
    named him Moses, 'Because,' she said, 'I drew him out of the water.'" Thus,
    Moses himself claimed that he was both named and adopted by Pharaoh's
    daughter. Stephen agrees, saying "Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and
    brought him up as her own son" (Acts 7:21). Then Stephen adds, "And Moses
    was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his
    words and deeds" (Acts 7:22).
</p>
<p>
    Moses had the best education available in one of the greatest dynasties
    ever to rule Egypt. His mind was filled with construction and statuary. He
    was trained as a military leader by a nation skilled in warfare. For most
    of 40 years he had seen his royal mother, Pharaoh Hatshepsut care for
    Egypt. He could appreciate freedom within limits, knowing that his people
    lived their own lives in a sense while also being used positively for
    Egypt's construction projects. But he had no idea how miserable they were,
    how mistreated they were. Then, for some unexplained reason, he visited his
    people when he was not expected and saw an Egyptian taskmaster unmercifully
    mistreating a Hebrew slave. In a fit of anger, he struck down the Egyptian
    and buried his body in the sand. When Pharaoh learned of this, he sought to
    kill Moses (Exodus 2:15). Moses fled.
</p>
<p>
    The experiences in Egypt were essential elements in preparing him for
    leadership during the 40-years Israel was in the wilderness and God was
    unfolding an earth-shaking plan for the Hebrew people. But he would need
    other training as well. The next 40 years were spent in the family of a
    true servant of the living God coping with the harsh climate of the
    wilderness and caring for sheep. Until Moses completed this new education,
    he would not be ready to shepherd God's flock.
</p>
<p>
    As to specific dates, Moses was born in 1526 BC. Most likely Pharaoh's
    daughter was younger rather than older at this time, maybe 15 years old.
    Possibly ten or fifteen years later she married her half-brother. Moses was
    40 in 1486 BC when he slew the Egyptian and fled for his life from Pharaoh
    Thutmose III who was in his twenties. It is noteworthy that Moses
    successfully fled and covered the distance to Midian, apparently all on his
    own.
</p>
<p>
    Egyptologists maintain a range of dates for the 18<sup>th</sup> Dynasty.
    They call the more recent dates the Low Chronology while the older dates
    are called the High Chronology. The biblical dates fall somewhere in the
    middle. Regarding the dates, Wikipedia includes an interesting caution:
    "These dates, just as all of the dates of the Eighteenth Dynasty, are open
    to dispute&#8230;"<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
