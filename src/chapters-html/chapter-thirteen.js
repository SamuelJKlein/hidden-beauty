<h2>
    Peleg, Joktan and the Table of Nations
</h2>
<p>
    For two hundred pages this book has suggested that Hebrew genealogies are
    mostly about identification, not succession, that they are often condensed,
    that 35-55 generations are missing between Eber and Peleg and that Job was
    born 8-9 generations before Peleg. Now Genesis ten appears, a fly in the
    ointment, two brothers to smite this tidy scheme. One brother continues the
    line to Christ; the other populates Arabia. They are placed in the fourth
    generation after the Flood.

        <sup>25</sup>
        To Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his
days the earth was divided, and his brother's name was Joktan.        <sup>26</sup>Joktan
    </a>
    fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, <sup>27</sup>Hadoram, Uzal,
    Diklah, <sup>28</sup>Obal, Abimael, Sheba, <sup>29</sup>Ophir, Havilah, and
    Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. Genesis 10:25-29.
</p>
<p>
    Not so fast. "Brother" is one of those elastic relational words used in
    both narrow and broad senses. The narrow sense would mean these two
    brothers had the same immediate father and lived at the same time. The
    broad sense would merely mean they both descended from the same forefather.
    Nehemiah 5:1 uses "brother" that way. Poor Jews called rich Jews brothers.
    They were brothers in the sense that they were all descendants of Abraham
    who lived 1500 years earlier.
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, these two brothers must be understood in the sense that Eber was
    their forefather. Genesis ten does not spoil the view of this book but
    provides another example to illustrate it. Both Peleg and Joktan descended
    from Eber. Peleg continued the line to Christ. Joktan populated Arabia.
    Peleg is named first due to importance, not birth order. He was born long
    after Joktan.
</p>
<p>
    The story of Peleg and Joktan appears in Genesis ten which is called the
    Table of Nations. It records the rise of certain people groups after the
    Flood. The next section is very tedious as it shows that the Table of
    Nations is not a genealogy, has a very specific purpose and therefore is
    extremely selective. Unless you are adamant that Peleg and Joktan were the
    next generation after Eber, you won't miss much if you simply trust us that
    the Table of Nations was not about genealogies but about succession and
    move on to the next chapter.
</p>
<h3>
    Table of Nations
</h3>
<h4>
    Selectivity of the Table of Nations
</h4>
<p>
    First, we must note how selective the Table of Nations is. On the Ark were
    Noah and his wife plus their three sons and three daughters-in-law-eight
    adults but no children. After the Flood those three sons fathered 16 named
    sons (5.33 sons per father) and presumably about that many daughters. This
    record of first-generation sons is most likely complete. But with the
    second generation the record becomes selective. Of the 16 first-generation
    sons, only the sons of seven are listed. Sons of the other nine are not
    mentioned. Many reasons are suggested for this such as not enough daughters
    to go around, untimely deaths, a preference for remaining single or even
    violence. Like Adam and Eve's oldest, they all possessed old sin natures.
    Those seven first- generation sons fathered 36 second-generation sons. But
    most likely the other nine also had sons but are not mentioned due to
    selectivity.
</p>
<p>
    Continuing, if the record of second-generation sons suggests selectivity,
    the record of third-generation sons shouts it-only three sons are recorded
    for the 36 second-generation men (0.08 sons per recorded second-generation
    male)! On the basis of 16 sons in the first generation 80 might be expected
    in the second and 400 in the third. Instead of 80 there are 36 and instead
    of 400 there are three. God commanded the Ark survivors to fill the earth
    with people. Either the record is extremely incomplete or the human race
    was heading towards extinction. Since the earth was being repopulated, the
    record was the problem. It is selective. The fourth generation is even
    worse-only two sons are named, the two brothers and they are actually
    brothers in the broad sense of having the same forefather, so, in effect,
    no fourth-generation son is listed.
</p>
<p>
    Looking at this selectivity another way, Ham had four sons and sons are
    listed for three (75%). Shem had five sons and sons are listed for two
    (40%). Japheth had seven sons, but sons for just two are listed (29%). What
    became of the unnamed offspring of the other nine first-generation sons and
    34 second-generation sons? Though not mentioned in Genesis 10, we know much
    about some from history. The Medes descended from Japheth's son Madai.
    Descending from Shem's sons Elam and Asshur were the Elamites and infamous
    Assyrians of Isaiah's day. But not all are so obvious. The identity of some
    is disputed; others remain unidentified. Without question the table of
    Nations is selective.
</p>
<h4>
    Purpose of the Table of Nations
</h4>
<p>
    The Table is not only selective but deliberate. These post-Flood people
    began to form people groups and nations. The record focuses on those
    nations that impacted the Hebrews. This is the reason for the Table of
    Nation's specific content. Nearness to or impact upon the Hebrews was the
    primary reason in deciding which names to include. The most space was given
    to Ham and his progeny. Both the Promised Land that God gave to Abraham's
    descendants and the surrounding nations were mostly occupied by them.
</p>
<p>
    Ham's son Canaan first settled the land of Canaan. No less than 11 sons are
    listed for him. These names occur again and again through Scripture as
    Israel struggled with them. Ham's son Mizraim and his seven sons settled
    the land of Egypt. That land also had a major impact on the Hebrews. In
    Egypt Jacob's sons and grandsons grew to a population exceeding two million
    souls. Egypt eventually enslaved them. Descendants of Ham's oldest son,
    Cush and his six sons, are listed because they populated areas near Goshen
    where the Hebrews sojourned in Egypt for 430-years. Moses, the editor of
    Genesis, would have been very aware of Egypt's Cushite neighbors. No sons
    are listed for Ham's other son Put most likely because they settled in
    lands more distant from Israel.
</p>
<p>
    While Shem had five sons the sons of only two are mentioned. Shelah
    continued the line leading to Christ and while Aram and his four sons
    provide context for the history of Israel. This makes sense since Aram was
    the father of the Aramaeans who populated Syria among other places. The
    Aramaeans were very significant in the life of Israel. By the time of
    Christ, the Aramaic language had replaced Hebrew in everyday life. Aram was
    also the father of Uz who established the land in which Job lived. To have
    possessed a large amount of land in Uz, Job would have had to be a direct
    descendant of Uz. Shem's other three sons, Elam, Asshur and Lud,
    contributed huge populations to the Near East and all are named before Aram
    but, amazingly, nothing is said of them.
</p>
<p>
    Sons of just two of Japheth's seven sons are named. From Gomer came many
    European peoples; but maybe Gomer's three sons are listed out of respect to
    him as Japheth's firstborn. Another, Javan and his four sons, leads to the
    Greeks and other Northeastern Mediterranean peoples. These would be
    significant in later Hebrew history as the Israelites interacted with those
    bordering the Mediterranean Sea.
</p>
<p>
    Puzzling is the naming of Cush's grandsons Sheba and Dedan, the only
    third-generation sons mentioned besides Shem's great grandson Eber.
    Including Eber is understandable since he is the third-generation ancestor
    leading to Abraham and Christ. Possibly Sheba and Dedan were named because
    they settled in Arabia and later intermarried with the descendants of
    Joktan and Abraham. They also are found in the book of Job.
</p>
<p>
    As previously stated, only two sons, Peleg and Joktan are named for the
    fourth generation. Since Peleg follows the 35-55 generation omission
    between Eber and Peleg, he wasn't a fourth-generation son. Rather, he and
    Joktan were "sons" in the broad sense of descendants of Eber and "brothers"
    in the broad sense of having the same forefather. While Peleg is mentioned
    first because of importance (he continued the line of Christ), Joktan was
    born many generations before Peleg and populated much of Arabia when Arabia
    was watered, fertile and covered with vegetation during the Ice Age.
    Astonishingly, out of the millions of sons born during the 35-55 generation
    omission, only the 13 sons of Joktan are named. His sons provide the
    background for the book of Job, Abraham and early Israel.
</p>
<p>
    Since God would give Abraham's descendants the land of Canaan, they needed
    to know about their neighbors and close relatives. Nearness to or impact
    upon the Hebrews was the primary reason in deciding which names to include
    in the Table of Nations. Yes, the Table of Nations was both selective and
    deliberate.
</p>
<h4>
    Other unique features of the Table
</h4>
<p>
    While the firstborn is usually named first, the Table places the record of
    Shem's descendants (Genesis 10:21-31) after those of Japheth (Genesis
    10:2-5) and Ham (Genesis 10:6-20). Several times Scripture deals with less
    important sons before getting to the most important son, the heir.
    Ishmael's genealogy (Genesis 25:12-18) precedes Isaac's genealogy (Genesis
    25:19 and following). Esau's genealogy (Genesis 36) comes long before
    Jacob's genealogy (Genesis 46).
</p>
<p>
    Possibly Arpachshad enjoyed the unique honor of being the first person born
    in the post-Flood world. While Scripture doesn't say that, it does say he
    was born two years after the Flood, i.e., after the beginning of the Flood
    (Genesis 11:10) and does not indicate that another person was born before
    him. Surprisingly he is named third, not first, in the list of Shem's five
    sons in the Table of Nations. Elam is the first name and Asshur is the
    second. Both had an enormous impact on the Near East in their day between
    Abraham and the Captivity.
</p>
<p>
    Elam appears again and again in Scripture. By the time Abraham arrived in
    the Promised Land, Chedorlaomer, King of Elam, had extended his scepter all
    the way to Sodom and Gomorrah, one thousand trade-route miles west of Elam
    (Genesis 14:4). Fifteen hundred years later Elam would be a major part of
    the Persian Empire. Asshur fathered the Assyrians that continued to be a
    great and powerful people in northeastern Mesopotamia. In terms of
    prominence these sons dwarfed Arpachshad. Maybe that is why he is listed
    third even though he was the firstborn. Clearly, birth order does not
    always dictate the order in which sons are listed in Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    Sons were sometimes named for famous forefathers or relatives. The first
    clear case of this after the Flood is the name Havilah. Cush had a son
    named Havilah who was one of the 36 sons named in the second generation.
    Eber's descendant Joktan also named a son "Havilah." Because the same names
    were used over and over in Bible days, one must be careful when identifying
    people in Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    The Table names 13 sons for Joktan and 11 for Canaan. Frequently those with
    many sons had multiple wives. While Jacob fathered 12 sons, they came
    through four wives. Abraham's brother Nahor had eight sons by one wife and
    four by another. Abraham himself had eight sons by three women. Esau had
    three wives to bear his 12 sons. King David had even more wives for his
    many sons. How many wives Joktan had in fathering 13 sons or Canaan had in
    fathering eleven sons is not stated. It would be conjecture to say all the
    sons of each father in this Table came from one wife. In determining
    population growth, it would likewise be a mistake to average the listed
    sons and then conclude that all males had an average of that many sons.
</p>
<p>
    After naming five sons and two grandsons of Cush in Genesis 10:7, verse
    eight says "Cush fathered Nimrod." Nimrod was not named in the list of
    Cush's sons but separately said to be fathered by Cush. This is a device
    for sake of emphasis. Scripture continues by devoting more text about
    Nimrod and his kingdoms than it does to the entire paragraph on Japheth.
    Nimrod's Babylon has opposed God from this early time through the Book of
    Revelation. Abraham's seed needed a strong warning about this kingdom that
    wars against God and therefore against Israel. Here is the warning right in
    the middle of the Table of Nations. Genesis ten is far more than a list of
    descendants born after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion, Genesis 10 is not a Table of Nations. It is an account of
    lines significant to God's plan to establish a called-out people and the
    promised Messiah. Specifically, Shem's great grandson had two descendants
    whom Genesis 10 calls brothers in the broad sense of both being descendants
    of the same man. One of the brothers would be born early in the 35-55
    generation gap between Eber and Peleg. Genesis 10 names his 13 sons, which
    is among the most sons listed for any father in Scripture. They began the
    populating of Arabia which was the most ideal and handy place to live
    during the Ice Age for those migrating from the Ark to Southern
    Mesopotamia. The other son lived over a thousand years later. His name,
    Peleg, means "divided by water." He was born when the Ice Age ended,
    raising sea level possibly 400 feet, covering the land bridges, dividing
    continents and producing islands. Getting Genesis 10 right is another
    critical step in understanding what Hebrew genealogies tell us about the
    history of the world and the approximate time of the Flood.
