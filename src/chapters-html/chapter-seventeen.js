<h2>
    Recent Scholarship Improves Biblical Understanding
</h2>
<p>
    Sixteen detailed chapters have presented arguments that the primary purpose
    of ancient Hebrew genealogies was identification, not succession. One
    doesn't have to be a genius to study the Scriptures themselves and let them
    reveal that
</p>
<p>
    1). Israel was in Egypt 430, not 215-years, and that
</p>
<p>
    2). Scripture uses words such as father and son in both narrow and broad
    senses.
</p>
<p>
    However, it takes considerably more skill to apply these ideas to the lists
    that do make a difference in the age of the earth and realize with
    confidence that
</p>
<p>
    1). the record condenses the Levi-Aaron genealogical list from over a dozen
    names to just four
</p>
<p>
    2). and condenses the Eber-Peleg sequence from an estimated 35-55 to two.
</p>
<p>
    But here is another lulu for the scholars: some lists include two Cainans,
    others only one. Does the Bible contain errors after all? Eric Lyons of
    Apologetic press may well have put his finger on it when he wrote: "the
    simple fact is, just because one genealogy has more or fewer names than
    another genealogy does not mean that the two genealogies contradict one
    another."<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Appendix Table
    8.8 contains a full report on his comments which in summary states that
    Hebrew genealogies need not be complete to accomplish the author's purpose.
</p>
<p>
    Today it is more evident than ever that we must acknowledge the enormous
    debt we owe to inerrancy Bible scholars who spend entire lifetimes
    examining new evidence that sheds light on manuscripts that seem to
    disagree. Guiding their work are the doctrines of inerrancy, transmission
    and preservation. Their scholarship in the Scriptures combined with these
    three doctrines is the subject of this chapter.
</p>
<p>
    Creation scientists who work hard to find the exact age of the earth have
    showcased how creation witnesses in so many ways to the existence of our
    wise, loving and powerful Creator God. They emphasize inerrancy. But their
    zeal in some cases is without knowledge. We love them for their
    contributions. Yet, we find it necessary to adjure them to appreciate and
    be informed by those who are renown in relevant biblical fields in which
    creation scientists have not specialized. We also ask them to correct their
    published errors in which they condemn these scholars who clearly have
    right answers.
</p>
<p>
    It may seem petty to insist that some two millennia passed between the
    Flood and Aaron, placing the Flood in the time frame of 3600-4300 BC rather
    than 2348-2550 BC. But in view of three-and-one-half centuries of
    discoveries since Ussher that have revealed a world of human activity after
    the Flood, his 2348 BC date becomes an embarrassing historical error. This
    means those in the creation movement who proclaim his time frame place a
    stigma of naivety and ignorance on the entire creation movement so it is
    dismissed as hopelessly uninformed. As a result, the work of creation
    scientists is mostly disregarded by the secular world.
</p>
<h3>
    Identifying True Genealogical Authorities
</h3>
<p>
    The leading source that advanced genealogies over other Scripture was James
    Ussher (1581-1656), Anglican Archbishop of Ireland from 1625 until his
    death. Ussher was a scholar and prolific writer for the faith. Of all his
    works, he is most remembered for <em>The Annuls of the World</em>, a
    classic survey of world history. <em>Annals</em>, written in Latin,
    appeared just six years before his death. Two years after he died its
    English translation appeared; in 2003 a modern English translation was
    released.
</p>
<p>
    In <em>Annals</em> Ussher advanced the idea that scriptural genealogies
    were complete and from their numbers the age of the earth (and universe)
    could be determined precisely. He found the date of creation to be the
    evening of October 23, 4004 BC, or in round numbers about 4000 years before
    the birth of Christ. He dated the Flood at 2348 BC. Young earth
    creationists frequently cite Ussher for their conviction that the age of
    the earth can be known within a few years.
</p>
<p>
    Ussher's scholarship and piety are indisputable. His world was learning,
    languages, books and writing. In diplomacy he managed to walk a narrow path
    between supporting the English monarchy while not offending the
    freedom-seeking Parliament, even asking their permission to move to
    England. He is said to have watched the execution of Charles I, but fainted
    before the ax fell. In spite of Ussher's strong support for the throne,
    Oliver Cromwell who led Parliament in opposing the unlimited power of the
    crown insisted that he have an elaborate state funeral and be buried at
    Westminster Abbey. Such was the esteem for his character.
</p>
<p>
    But Ussher labored under enormous handicaps. For instance, the contribution
    of archaeology to ancient history was still several centuries away. The
    great ancient manuscript discoveries were yet to be made. Hieroglyphics and
    cuneiform would not be deciphered for another 200 years. Scholars were far
    more limited in their access to rare books for primary research. While
    scribes came to take great care in copying Scripture by the eighth century
    AD, they passed on the mistakes of earlier scribes. Since the venerable
    Bishop, those who serve God by laboring to determine precisely every letter
    or mark of the original Old Testament Hebrew text have made many textual
    improvements even though their work will never be completed.
</p>
<p>
    The field that deals with textual accuracy lies within the general area of
    "Semitics and Old Testament Studies." Experts in it have mastered not only
    the original language of the Old Testament but also related Semitic
    languages and often spend a lifetime studying, writing about and teaching
    the fruit of this discipline. In addition, they have learned the broad
    fields of biblical archaeology and ancient Near East history and for those
    of faith, they pretty much know the Scriptures backwards and forwards.
    Invariably, these individuals have brilliant minds and are the top
    students. These are the authorities conservative evangelicals can trust to
    provide sound interpretations to the genealogical lists of the OT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dr. Merrill F. Unger</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Among such modern scholars are Merrill F. Unger and Eugene H. Merrill.
    Unger, 1909-1980, maintained an amazing straight A record in all his course
    work at Dallas Theological Seminary leading to Master of Theology and
    Doctor of Theology degrees (possibly the only Dallas student ever to do
    so). The Master of Theology degree is a professional degree representing
    four years of course work beyond an acceptable college degree. Unger earned
    his A.B. and Ph.D. degrees from world renowned Johns Hopkins University in
    his home town of Baltimore Maryland. His Ph.D. was in Semitics and Old
    Testament Studies. He grew thriving churches, was a popular conference
    speaker, chaired the Department of Old Testament during his entire 19-year
    tenure at Dallas Theological Seminary, taught Hebrew for years and wrote 26
    books. When he retired in 1967 the school made him Distinguished Professor
    Emeritus of Old Testament for life. Such was the esteem in which he was
    held.
</p>
<p>
    Eugene H. Merrill (1934-Present) represents the next generation in the
    Unger tradition. He earned two Ph.D. degrees, first at his B.A. and M.A.
    alma mater, Bob Jones University and the second in Middle Eastern Studies
    at Columbia University. He earned three masters degrees including one at
    Columbia University in the field of his doctoral degree and one at New York
    University in Jewish Studies. He taught in the Old Testament Department at
    Dallas Theological Seminary, one of the world's largest Evangelical
    seminaries, for over 35 years and upon retirement in 2013 was named
    Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Old Testament Studies. He has written
    ten books and some 200 articles, mainly of a historical and exegetical
    nature. He is an active churchman and preaches and teaches abroad on a
    regular basis.
</p>
<p>
    But who promotes Ussher's view on the age of the earth today? Certainly not
    Unger or Merrill! These scholars find Ussher's view of a short Egyptian
    sojourn and his opinion that the genealogies were comprehensive to be
    contrary to both Scripture and the history of the ancient Near East. Dr.
    Unger felt so strongly about this error that he addressed it in
considerable detail under the entry "Genealogy" of    <em>Unger's Bible Dictionary</em>, and, the <em>Dictionary</em> itself,
    which as explained earlier, represented the work of many Bible scholars
    over an entire century. It expresses the standard thinking of conservative
    evangelical biblical scholars. The following is an excerpt from his
    article:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        B. B. Warfield showed more than a generation ago that the Bible
        genealogies contained gaps ("The Antiquity and Unity of the Human
        Race," <em>Studies in Theology</em>, New York, 1932, pp. 235-258). The
        genealogies in Exod. 6:16-24, Ezra 7:1-5 and Matt. 1:1-17 contain
        omissions. This is most certainly the case also in the genealogical
        lists in Genesis 5 and 11. To use these genealogical lists in Genesis
        to calculate the creation of man (c. 4004 B.C.), as Archbishop Ussher
        has done, is not only unwarranted from a comparative study of
        Scriptural genealogies, but incontestably disproved by the
        well-attested facts of modern archaeology. The total length of the
        period from the creation of man to the flood and from the flood to
        Abraham is not specified in Scripture. That the genealogies of Gen. 5
        and 11 are most assuredly drastically abbreviated and have names that
        are highly selective is suggested by the fact that each list contains
        only ten names, ten from Adam to Noah and ten from Shem to Abraham. It
        is quite evident that symmetry was the goal in constructing these
        genealogical lists rather than a setting forth of unbroken descent from
        father to son, in contrast to modern registers of pedigree. Such
        symmetry with the omission of certain names is obvious from the
        genealogy of Matt. 1:1-17. This fact is further corroborated by the
        evident latitude used in ancient Semitic languages in the expressions
        "begat," "bear," "father," and "son." This usage is completely contrary
        to English idiom. Thus to "beget" a "son" may mean to beget an actual
        child or a grandchild or a great grandchild or even distant
        descendants. Usage extends to tribes or countries (Gen. 10:2-22), and
        even to non-blood relationship. Jehu, the usurper and founder of a new
        dynasty in Israel and with no blood connection whatsoever to the House
        of Omri, is nevertheless called "son of Omri" by Shalmaneser III of
Assyria. (Daniel David Luckenbill,        <em>Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia I</em>, Sect. 590.)
        Nebuchadnezzar is called the "father" of Belshazzar who was actually
        the son of Nabonidus, a usurper (Dan. 5:2). Accordingly, as J. H. Raven
        says in the regular recurring formula, "A lived . . . years and begat
        B, and A lived after he begat B . . . years and begat sons and
        daughters, and B lived . . . years and begat C," B may not be the
        literal son of A but a distant descendant. If so, the age of A is his
        age at the birth of the child from whom B is descended. Between A and
        B, accordingly, many centuries may intervene. The Genesis genealogical
        lists are not intended to divulge the antiquity of man upon the earth,
        but to set forth in outstanding representative names the line of the
        promised Redeemer (Gen. 3:15) from Adam to Abraham and to show the
        effects of sin and the altered conditions brought about by the flood
        and upon human vitality and longevity. Added evidence that the
        genealogies of Gen. 5 and 11 contain extensive breaks is demonstrated
        by the fact that they allow only about 4000 years from the creation of
        Adam to Christ. On the other hand, modern archaeology clearly traces
        sedimentary pottery cultures such as that from Tell Halaf well before
        4000 B. C. To place the flood so late as 2348 B. C. as is the case if
        the genealogies are employed for chronological purposes, is
        archaeologically fantastic. This great cataclysm certainly took place
        long before 4000 B. C. Revised by M.F.U.

</p>
<p>
    Before discovering this section by Unger this author had determined to
    restrict his research to the study of Scripture itself, particularly those
    passages of possible abbreviated genealogies suggested by conservative
    authorities and further passages those passages led to, rather than
    Scripture plus secular disciplines such as archaeology and ancient Near
    East history. This approach yielded numerous examples of abbreviated
    genealogies. This was done with the background of a seminary degree, a
    lifetime of study in the Scriptures and average academic ability.
</p>
<p>
    Moreover, while many creation science authors have spent a proportionate
    amount of study in some field of science, they lack such ancient Near East
    training. It seems appropriate to ask them to defer to inerrancy experts
    with extensive scriptural training and not to berate them when they reject
    Ussher's view. While those more theologically trained and those more
    scientifically trained both believe in inerrancy, the latter show
    themselves to be weak in their knowledge of biblical expertise when they
    become inappropriately dogmatic in their biblical viewpoint. Further, this
    rides against the principal of Ephesians 4:2-3 to maintain "the unity of
    the Spirit in the bond of peace."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dr. Eugene H. Merrill</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following pages particularize what it takes to be an expert in the
    fields of manuscript study with its many nuances of textual understanding
    and interpretation. Dr. Eugene H. Merrill is used to represent the next
    generation of scholars in the Unger tradition. He devotes many pages in
    support of the generally accepted dates among conservative evangelical
    scholars such as the following statements concerning the time in Egypt:
</p>
<p>
    I Kings 6:1&#8230;informs us that Solomon began to build his temple in his
    fourth year (967/966) which was also the 480<sup>th</sup> year after the
    Exodus. This places the date of the Exodus at 1446 B.C. In Exodus 12:40 we
learn that Israel was in Egypt 430-years&#8230;"    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><strong>[3]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    Today most young earth creation leaders who speak on the subject still
    advocate Ussher's methodology and dates. They turn a deaf ear to three and
    a half centuries of manuscript discovery and textual refinements. Worst of
    all they possess none of the qualifications of true scholars such as Unger
    and Merrill for determining the truth of matters in these fields, yet they
    write entire books to perpetuate their errors. Undiscerning creation
    scientists are taken in by their pseudo knowledge and authority claims and
    perpetuate their errors. One of these current so-called authorities uses
    7000 words to argue that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years while
    Moses needed only 12 words to write "the time the people of Israel lived in
    Egypt was 430-years" (Exodus 12:40). Surprisingly many creationists take
    this man's words over those of Moses. "This is not good," you say. Most
    would agree. Those in the creation movement need to learn from genuine
    conservative evangelical scholars instead of those who multiply arguments
    to perpetuate the errors of the past.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Another Uninformed Response: The Two Cainans</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Appendix 8.8 addressed the problem of the two Cainans in Luke three. It
    reported how a leading creation apologist answered this problem by using
    material up to two centuries old. The Dead Sea Scrolls which have only
    recently been available falsify that two-century-old material. Sadly, that
    creation scientist is using his fine mind to perpetuate the Ussher error
    rather than carefully examining the work of today's true inerrancy OT
    scholars. God protects the Body of Christ through these scholars whose
    lives are devoted to the fields that addresses the Old Testament text.
    Deferring to their learning will save much confusion and misinformation.
</p>
<h3>
    Inerrancy Confused with Preservation
</h3>
<p>
    Some Ussher supporters back their chronology by appealing to a faulty view
    of the preservation of Scripture. They declare that God has promised to
    preserve the actual text of Scripture, the actual words of God including
    every original jot and tittle (Matthew 5:17). Some even maintain that only
    one Hebrew OT text and one Greek NT text contain the Scripture free of
    error. Compounding this error, some go so far as to believe that the King
    James Version is a divinely inspired translation and the only true Word of
    God in the English language.
</p>
<p>
    Neither Matthew 5:17 nor its context says that the written text of
    Scripture will be preserved without error in any one manuscript. What it
    does say is that God will fulfill all that the Law and the Prophets have
    said. When this is pointed out they jump to various other verses such as
    Romans 3:2, Mark 13:31, Jeremiah 1:12, Isaiah 40:8 and Psalm 12:6-7. But
    none of these verses support their view either. Rather, they promise that
    God will do what He has said and that what He said is true and lasting.
    Consequently, their view is both unbiblical and, in effect, trumps EVERY
    manuscript find and textual refinement. It says textual scholars are
    unneeded and archaeologists should disregard any biblical texts they
    unearth.
</p>
<p>
    This overemphasis on preservation is actually an attack on the word and
    character of God-God didn't say that and if He had, He would be guilty of
    error. Yet everything God says is true-His word and His character remain
    unstained. This view confuses preservation with inerrancy. While inerrancy
    is held by all conservative evangelicals, this view of preservation is held
    by only a handful of advocates and the many thousands they have misled with
    their rhetoric. So what are the true doctrines of inerrancy, preservation
    and transmission?
</p>
<p>
    Theologians use three words to speak of the fact that Scripture is without
    error-infallibility, inspiration and inerrancy. They apply only to the
    original writings. "Infallibility" means "without error" and is becoming
    the least used of these three words. "Inspiration" comes from II Timothy
    3:16 and begins Dallas Theological Seminary's Statement of Faith. It has to
    do with the method God used to give the Bible:
</p>
<p>
    We believe that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God," [II Timothy
    3:16] by which we understand the whole Bible is inspired in the sense that
    holy men of God "were moved by the Holy Spirit" to write the very words of
    Scripture. We believe that this divine inspiration extends equally and
    fully to all parts of the writings-historical, poetical, doctrinal, and
    prophetical-as appeared in the original manuscripts. We believe that the
    whole Bible in the originals is therefore without error. We believe that
    all the Scriptures center about the Lord Jesus Christ in His person and
    work in His first and second coming, and hence that no portion, even of the
    Old Testament, is properly read, or understood, until it leads to Him. We
    also believe that all the Scriptures were designed for our practical
instruction (<a href="http://bib.ly/Mk12.26">Mark 12:26</a>,<a href="http://bib.ly/Mk12.36">36</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Mk13.11">13:11</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Lk24.27">Luke 24:27</a>,<a href="http://bib.ly/Lk24.44">44</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Jn5.39">John 5:39</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ac1.16">Acts 1:16</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ac17.2-3">17:2-3</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ac18.28">18:28</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ac26.22-23">26:22-23</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ac28.23">28:23</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/Ro15.4">Rom. 15:4</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/1Co2.13">1 Cor. 2:13</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/1Co10.11">10:11</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/2Ti3.16">2 Tim. 3:16</a>;<a href="http://bib.ly/2Pe1.21">2 Pet. 1:21</a>).    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><strong>[4]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    Former Dallas professor of theology Dr. Charles Ryrie summarized
    inspiration as "God's superintending of human authors so that, using their
    own individual personalities, they composed and recorded without error in
the words of the original autographs His revelation to man."    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
</p>
<p>
    In recent years a large body of scholarly statements has developed around
    the word "inerrancy." A famous gathering of leading theologians, the
    Chicago Conference on Inerrancy, developed the following ideas: "Inerrancy
    is the view that when all the facts become known, they will demonstrate
that the <a href="http://www.theopedia.com/Bible">Bible</a>    <em>in its original autographs </em>and correctly interpreted is entirely
    true and never false in all it affirms, whether that relates to doctrines
    or ethics or to the social, physical, or life sciences" (emphasis ours).
    But they make the important distinction noted above: "We affirm that
    inspiration, strictly speaking, applies only to the autographic text of
    Scripture, which in the providence of God can be ascertained from available
    manuscripts with great accuracy. We further affirm that copies and
    translations of Scripture are the Word of God to the extent that they
faithfully represent the original."    <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Leading conservative theologians regard the Chicago Statement as a very
    thorough statement of what "inerrancy" involves. The statement elaborates
    on various details in Articles formed as couplets of "We affirm &#8230; We
deny &#8230;." Also in this Statement, inerrancy applies only to the    <em>original manuscripts </em>(which no longer exist, but can be inferred
    on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or translations
    themselves. Further, inerrancy does <em>not </em>mean blind literalism, but
    allows for figurative, poetic and phenomenological language, as long as it
    is <em>accurate</em>. Nor does the Statement define the precise set of
    biblical books to be considered "Scripture."
</p>
<p>
    Dallas Seminary graduate and Bible teacher Hampton Keathley defined
    "Inerrancy" as
</p>
<p>
    ...a term used to explain that the Bible is completely true and contains no
    errors in the original autographs. The reason inerrancy is an issue is
    because some religious "scholars" believe that the scripture contains
    errors, yet they continue to claim to believe in "inspiration." Actually,
    they're trying to redefine "inspiration" to include possible errors.
    Therefore, it is necessary to discuss "inerrancy" because it assures that
we understand inspiration to mean "without error."    <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><strong>[7]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    In the same place Keathley summarizes that "[Inerrancy means] freedom from
    error or untruths. Synonyms include 'certainty, assuredness, objective
    certainty, infallibility.'"
</p>
<p>
    Thus, an accurate description about the truthfulness of Scripture is that
    its authors were guided or inspired by the Holy Spirit so that without
    waving their personalities or cultures, they were able to pen what God
    wanted written without error. It only applies to the very document that
    author composed.
</p>
<h3>
    The Ongoing Process of Preservation and Transmission
</h3>
<p>
    In contrast to the doctrine of infallibility/inspiration/inerrancy which
    relates to the original writings, the activities of preservation and
    transmission spread God's revelation in every generation to the entire
    world with sufficient integrity that man can come to know Him and do His
    will. The Chicago Conference put it this way: "we deny that any essential
    element of the Christian faith is affected by the absence of the
    autographs. We further deny that this absence renders the assertion of
Biblical inerrancy invalid or irrelevant."    <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The idea of preservation focuses on the quality of the Scriptures available
    today. How true are they to the originals? The answer comes from several
    directions. One is reliability. Copies of many ancient manuscripts have
    come down to the present. Like the Scriptures their originals have also
    been lost. Like the Scriptures, scholars have collected copies of them and
    compared the copies to determine how much change has crept in. In doing so
    the world of scholarship has come to realize that there are vastly more
    copies of ancient scriptural texts than nearly all other ancient works.
    Through comparing these texts scholars have learned just how carefully the
    Scriptures have been preserved. Thus, this preservation is an astonishing
    testimony to the divine hand behind it. It far exceeds other ancient books
    in trueness to the original writings. The general conclusion is that
    Scripture has been preserved vastly beyond most other works.
</p>
<p>
    Certainly, God the Holy Spirit moved the followers of Christ to put forth
    the massive effort required to produce so many copies of Scripture that
    survive from antiquity. The facts regarding this massive body of texts is
featured on the website maintained by Josh McDowell Ministries.    <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> Thus, it is no
    exaggeration to say that no other ancient text begins to compare with the
    reliability of Scripture. In this way God has preserved His Word.
</p>
<p>
    Another way in which God has preserved His revelation to mankind is by its
    repetition. God led different authors to state the same truths so that if
    the truth was obscured or even lost in one or two places, it would be
    correctly preserved in other portions of Scripture. By stating every major
    doctrine again and again in different places and in different ways, man is
    not without a clear understanding of any major doctrine of Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    The work of God in preserving Scripture and the work of man in transmitting
    Scripture can be likened to a partnership. As the various books of the
    Bible were penned, others would want the writing, so copies were prepared.
    Copies wore out, so new copies were made. Over time Scripture was
    translated into the primary languages of people world-wide. All this
    copying and translating was a matter of transmission. Transmission was (and
    is) man's part who hopefully is looking to the Holy Spirit for enablement.
</p>
<p>
    As we study this partnership, we realize God did not promise to preserve
    the Scriptures without error as they were transmitted through history. In
    all, about 1% of the text was subject to question at the time of the rise
    of intense textual studies two centuries ago. In fact scholars have
    compiled a considerable list of errors found in any text, whether it be the
    Masoretic Text tradition or the ancient manuscript finds or the Septuagint.
</p>
<p>
    In recent years with a vast number of manuscripts to make comparisons,
    textual scholars have never been busier. For example, they can now compare
    the Dead Sea Scrolls with the current MT and LXX. When there is a
    difference, they must debate which spelling, which form of a word or even
    which word is the correct reading. Sometimes the Hebrew MT is the preferred
    choice. Sometimes the Greek LXX reading is selected. Sometimes a third or
    fourth textual family is preferred. In this way God has made His people
    (all believers) partners with Him in the integrity of Scripture so we would
    continue to strive for the best possible rendering of the autographs.
    Again, in this partnership God does the necessary preserving while man does
    the transmitting. Only preserving must not be equated with inerrancy. This
    may be a difficult truth for some to grasp but it does have a practical
    application. Maybe this is another way our Father is trying to tell us He
    doesn't want us to strain over the exact age of the earth for He Himself
    has not stated it. It is enough that we know the earth (and the universe)
    is exceedingly young, probably only 7000-9000 years old.
</p>
<p>
    Far more basic is the authority of Scripture. It is the key issue for the
    Christian church in this and every age. Thus, various dangers must be
    avoided. The most obvious is denying the divine origin of Scripture
    altogether which is an expression of unbelief and a rejection of God. But
    people of faith can also err in many ways concerning Scripture. The one
    addressed in these paragraphs is to exaggerate the doctrine of preservation
    and minimize the work of transmission. A proper balance between these two
    concepts must be found just as a proper balance between the sovereignty of
    God and the accountability of man must be found. Happily, the informed
    Christian will avoid an overemphasis on the preservation of Scripture. For
    even though we do not have those original autographs, the Scriptures are
    trustworthy and totally sufficient to unite the one who receives them with
    the God who gave them.
</p>
<p>
    Someone may object, saying that the scribes had a strict procedure for
    copying. It is true that beginning about 500 AD an extended family of
    scribes called Masoretes living in the vicinity of Tiberias Israel began to
    develop procedures to guard against copying mistakes. Over the centuries
    other scribes adopted these procedures and by about 800 AD they were pretty
    much the standard. But that was 1000 years after the LXX and 1200 years
    after the writing of the last Old Testament book. In that millennium many
    copying errors crept into the various texts. While most of them are mere
    matters of spelling, some are matters of the text itself like the erroneous
    text of Exodus 12:40 in the MT (see chapter 2B, The Witness of Moses.)
</p>
<p>
    Getting the distinction between the doctrines of inerrancy and preservation
    right is essential in honoring the integrity of God. As creationists
    declare the primary evidence for God, of all Christians they need to make
    sure they understand and teach this distinction lest they defeat their very
    objective.
