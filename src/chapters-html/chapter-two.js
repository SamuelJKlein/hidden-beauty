    <h2>
        Four Witnesses to a 430-year Sojourn in Egypt
    </h2>
    <p>
        To build a case for the contention of this book, that 35-55 generations
        are omitted in Shem's genealogy, chapter one explained that beyond
        question the Levi-Aaron list omits generations, possibly 8-12. Clearly,
        the Hebrews abbreviated their genealogies. But this could only be true
        if Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years and the traditional view was
        215, not 430-years. God, Moses, Stephen and Paul speak to the issue.
        Beyond doubt they testify to a 430-Year Egyptian sojourn. Consequently,
        this chapter must examine the testimony of these four in considerable
        detail because the past confusion is still bothersome. In the process
        it will become apparent why the 215-year option was preferred but is
        now obviously incorrect.
    </p>
    <p>
        God Himself in Genesis 15 is the first witness. He spoke of 400 years
        of affliction but did not name the country where the affliction would
        occur. However, He did say Israel would come out of that country in the
        4<sup>th</sup> generation. That sounded more like 215-years than 430 to
        the traditionalists. The second witness, Moses, wrote about 430-years
        but his words could be understood as a total of 430-years between
        Canaan and Egypt until a corruption in the text was corrected in modern
        times. The third witness, Stephen, quoted God's 400 years so his words
        fall in the same camp as God's. The final witness, Paul, quoted Moses'
        430-years but his words are usually understood to be the total time in
        Canaan and Egypt so he was viewed as supporting 215-years.
    </p>
    <p>
        Josephus, the church fathers, Ussher, the Reformers and the King James
        translators all held the 215-year view, but looking back, they were the
        victims of historical inaccuracies. Many in the inerrancy camp are
        still in this fog. The following will give better material for an
        informed view.
    </p>
    <h3>
        A. The Witness of God-Genesis 15:12-16
    </h3>
    <p>
        When Abraham was a young man, God was searching for a vessel to greatly
        further His work among mankind and begin a line of men who would know
        Him. Their descendants would eventually become a nation that declared
        His ways and produced both the Bible and the Messiah. The man God
        called was Abraham. In the beginning Abraham did not know God. He and
        his relatives were idol worshippers. They lived in one of the most
        culturally advanced cities on planet earth, but it had forsaken the
        knowledge of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even yet, God appeared to him and told him to separate from his
        remarkable city, his many relatives, even from his father's house and
        follow God to an undisclosed location. If he met those four conditions,
        God promised that his name would be great, that he would become a great
        nation and that in him all the earth would be blessed. Heady stuff!
        Eventually Abraham would fully obey so that God could fulfill His
        promises.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Need for a Covenant
    </h4>
    <p>
        God cannot lie because His word proceeds from His nature-perfect
        righteousness. All His promises to Abraham were real and would happen.
        However, the road to becoming a great nation would be incredibly
        difficult and take many generations. His descendants would eventually
        be reduced to slavery in another land. While the promises were certain,
        hardships along the way might lead to despair so God reassured Abraham
        as well as his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob with visitation after
        visitation, repeating and even expanding the promises.
    </p>
    <p>
        The visitation in which God disclosed the frightening news that the
        path involved 400 years of affliction stood above all others. In
        Genesis 15 God made a blood covenant, swearing by Himself alone that no
        matter what, He would unconditionally do what He had promised. In the
        vision God was saying, "May I be like the slain animals of the covenant
        if I do not keep my word to you." There was nothing Abraham or his
        descendants could do to produce the results of the covenant except obey
        God. Fulfilling the promises would be the supernatural work of God.
    </p>
    <p>
        This covenant was given about ten years after Abraham followed God to
        the Promised Land. Abraham and his descendants needed to have clearly
        in their minds that a time of fearful terror lay ahead. This horrible
        period would happen in another land. God would be with them and their
        oppression would finally end with them suddenly becoming a great and
        wealthy nation. As for Abraham, he would die in peace before this
        period of servitude began.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Setting for the Covenant-Genesis 15:1-11
    </h4>
    <p>
        Genesis 15 opens with Abraham gripped in fear. The preceding fall he
        had rescued Lot from the invasion of four powerful Mesopotamian armies
        and slaughtered its soldiers. Now it was the next spring, the time when
        armies went on the march. Abraham was scaring himself to death as he
        envisioned the certain revenge for which he was no match. In addition
        he had turned his back on the spoils of his victory and was being stung
        with criticism for such a foolish act. These thoughts left him in deep
        distress.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then God's word came to Abraham in a vision, saying "Fear not, Abram. I
        am your shield; your reward shall be very great" (Genesis 15:1). God
        was saying that the mightiest army in the world could not harm him
        because the God of creation would be his defense. In addition, God
        would give him a far greater reward than the spoils of Sodom he
        refused.
    </p>
    <p>
        Abraham had other troubling thoughts. How could he become a nation when
        he didn't even have a son? God replied that he would have a son and his
        descendants would be like the stars-more numerous than he could number.
        Abraham asked how he could be sure this would happen. God told Abraham
        to cut in half a heifer, a goat and a ram and lay the halves on either
        side of a path. After foretelling key events of the next 700 years God
        alone passed between the bloody pieces of the animals thereby signing
        the covenant and making Him alone responsible for its fulfillment.
    </p>
    <h4>
        Terrifying Times Ahead - Genesis 15:12-16
    </h4>
    <p>
        About dusk, in his vision Abraham fell asleep. Then God made him sense
        the horrors his descendants would experience during a future time of
        servitude. That nightmare is described in Genesis 15:12 while its
        meaning is explained in the next four verses. Abraham's offspring would
        be aliens in a foreign country. There they would suffer affliction 400
        years. But they would not be destroyed. Instead they would return to
        this Promised Land in great numbers and with great wealth. They could
        not take possession of the land yet because others were still entitled
        to it. But the land was Abraham's and his descendants by right of
        divine promise. As for Abraham, this dark period would not touch him.
        He would die in peace. Is this indeed what these verses are saying or
        is the traditional explanation to be preferred?
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            <sup>12</sup>
            As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram. And behold,
            dreadful and great darkness fell upon him. <sup>13</sup>Then the
            LORD said to Abram, "Know for certain that your offspring will be
            sojourners in a land that is not theirs and will be servants there,
            and they will be afflicted for four hundred years." Genesis
            15:12-13.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Grouping these two verses together shows the terrifying sense of danger
        that came over Abraham and the divine explanation for it. The
        traditional viewpoint generally ignores the dread of verse 12 and
        begins with God's words in verse 13. But without acknowledging the
        overwhelming darkness, any explanation of verse 13 will overlook its
        intent. The table below examines God's explanation for the cause of
        Abraham's fear. It contains six elements (left column) together with a
        reasonable explanation of each element. Most explanations are obvious
        while several may be more interpretative, but all are consistent. The
        right column expresses how the traditional view interprets the six
        elements.

<p>
    Their explanation actually violates some of the elements of God's words.
    The traditionalists have this difficulty because God says in verse 16 that
    Abraham's descendants will return to Canaan in the fourth generation. They
    feel four generations demand a 215-year Egyptian sojourn, so they have no
    other choice than to wrench some of God's clear statements in verse 13 as
    well as verses 14 and 15. Besides all this confusion in attempting a
    consistent interpretation, various 215-year supporters give interpretations
    of verses 13-16 that even disagree with each other. Clearly their
    explanation of Genesis 15:12-16 is inconsistent and must be rejected.
</p>
<p>
    But there is more. God continues&#8230;
</p>
<p>
    <sup>14</sup>
    <strong>
        But I will bring judgment on the nation that they serve, and afterward
        they shall come out with great possessions. <sup>15</sup>As for you,
        you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good
        old age. <sup>16</sup>And they shall come back here in the fourth
        generation, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.
        Genesis 15:14-16.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The two assertions of verse fourteen are momentous in their own right. God
    would judge the nation that enslaved His people and His people would come
    forth from that nation with "great possessions." Over 430-years Jacob's
    small band multiplied to a population of several million. Then, when God
    ordered the oppressing nation to free His people which it refused to do, He
    sent ten devastating plagues of judgment. With that, the oppressors urged
    His people to leave before they all perished and sent them away with
    valuable gifts. A few days later, the nation had a change of heart and sent
    its chariot army to bring the Hebrews back. God thwarted this effort by
    destroying their military force in the waters of the Red Sea.
</p>
<p>
    All this happened in the land of Egypt. Egypt was not promised to the
    Hebrews but was the land in which they would become servants, the land
    where they would be afflicted four hundred years. Egypt was the nation God
    would judge and its wealth would enrich His people.
</p>
<p>
    God spends all of verse 15 with words of assurance to Abraham-he would not
    endure the grueling slavery destined for his descendants. While it might be
    possible to argue that verse 13 implies the affliction would touch Abraham
    as well, God clearly rules out Abraham's participation in this sojourn of
    servitude with these key phrases: "As for you," "go to your fathers in
    peace," and "buried in a good old age." In the light of these words, it is
    hard to understand how the traditional view can insist that Abraham shared
    in the affliction of verse thirteen.
</p>
<h4>
    Three momentous assertions by Jehovah
</h4>
<p>
    <strong>
        And they shall come back here in the fourth generation, for the
        iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Genesis 15:16.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. "And they shall come back here." Hundreds of years of affliction, some
    involving grinding slavery would not annihilate Abraham's descendants. They
    would be given the Promised Land just as Jehovah had covenanted.
</p>
<p>
    2. "In the fourth generation." God did not give a vague promise of a return
    "someday." This specific time marker would constantly provide hope during
    the period of affliction.
</p>
<p>
    3. "For the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete." Amorites
    occupied the land God promised Abraham. While God is longsuffering, there
    is a point where a people group has advanced so deeply into sin that hardly
    anyone in it can get come to know Him. Thus, He must remove that entire
    people group. God saw the direction and result of their iniquity. It was
    headed towards the place where justice would obligate Him to remove them.
    Once their iniquity was complete they surrendered their right to the land
    and God was free to give it to others. God would remove the populous
    city-state of Sodom just years later for this very reason; there weren't
    even ten righteous in it. So verse 16 provided another reason for the
    lengthy stay in Egypt and thus the need for patience until the right time
    arrived.
</p>
<h4>
    Genesis 15:16-Fourth Generation Promise
</h4>
<p>
    The statements about returning to Canaan and the Amorites' iniquity are
    clear and understandable but what did God mean by His statement that they
    would return in the fourth generation? It means, says the majority view,
    the fourth generation of Israelites in Egypt would return to Canaan. They
    claim this proves a 215-year Egyptian sojourn and eliminates a 430-year
    Egyptian sojourn, since four generations could reach 215-years, but not
    430-years. They point to Exodus six which names four generations ending
    with Moses and Aaron who participated in the Exodus (passage cited below).
    Exodus six records that Levi had a son named Kohath. Kohath had a son named
    Amram and Amram had two sons, Moses and Aaron. The four generations were
    Levi, Kohath, Amram and Aaron. While this explanation requires strained
    explanations for a dozen other details in Genesis 15:12-16 it is the only
    way, they say.
</p>
<p>
    But this idea doesn't work because Aaron had four grown sons at the time of
    the Exodus. If Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron were the right four generations, God
    did not keep His promise. To make matters worse Exodus six also names
    Aaron's grandson, Phinehas, who possibly was born in Egypt. Maybe Levi's
    line came out in the sixth generation. Others have recognized this problem
    and attempted to identify four other generations, but none work. The fact
    is, the four generations can't be found if "fourth generation" is
    interpreted as four consecutive father-son generations. The critical verses
    are found in Exodus 6:16, 18, 20, 23 and 25:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>16</sup>
    <strong>
        These are the names of the sons of <u>Levi</u> according to their
        generations: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, the years of the life of Levi
        being 137 years. <sup>18</sup>The sons of <u>Kohath</u>: Amram, Izhar,
Hebron, and Uzziel, the years of the life of Kohath being 133 years.        <sup>20</sup><u>Amram</u> took as his wife Jockebed his father's
        sister, and she bore him <u>Aaron</u> and Moses, the years of the life
        of Amram being 137 years. <sup>23</sup>Aaron took as his wife Elisheba,
the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she bore him        <u>Nadab, Abihu</u>, <u>Eleazar, and Ithamar</u>. <sup>25</sup>Eleazar,
        Aaron's son, took as his wife one of the daughters of Putiel, and she
        bore him <u>Phinehas</u>. (Emphasis ours.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    "Coming out in the fourth generation" also raises the question, "How many
    years elapsed from the start of one generation to the start of the next?
    While many years elapsed in the generations of Terah, Abraham, Isaac and
    Jacob, beginning with Jacob's sons new generations generally started every
    20 to 30 years. At that rate four generations would place the deliverance
    in 80 to 120 years (20x4=80; 30x4=120). Such a time frame even falls short
    of 215-years in Egypt. Further, God does not say four special generations
    but simply four generations. Everyone could count the generations in his
    family and expect deliverance when the number reached four.
</p>
<h4>
    "Generations" as "Lifetimes"
</h4>
<p>
    If a way could be found to harmonize the "either/or" verses, it would be a
    "both/and" victory for inerrancy. All the verses and each statement of each
    verse could be embraced without qualification, without diminishing, without
    violating inerrancy. We suggest that way is in a full understanding of the
    Hebrew concept of genealogies. It is much broader than in other cultures.
    Here the generations would be lifetimes-Israel would come out in four
    lifetimes, or in the fourth lifetime. Add up four known lifetimes and
    before the end of the fourth, Israel would come out of Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Moses wrote these words. He must have puzzled over what God had told
    Abraham 600 years before. He doesn't identify four successive generations
    (the 215-year interpretation) but he does provide the numbers to make the
    idea of "lifetimes" work. He lists 40 men in the genealogies of Exodus six
    but amazingly he only records the ages of three: Levi-137 years (6:16);
    Kohath-133 years (6:18) and Amram-137 years (6:20). Their ages added
    together total 407 years. In the next chapter Moses wrote, "Now Moses was
    eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to
    Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:7). Those confrontations produced the Exodus. Adding
    those 83 years to the 407 years gives a total of 490 years, which more than
    covers a 430-year Egyptian sojourn (137+133+137+83=490). So a perfectly
    satisfactory interpretation is that in the total of four lifetimes or in
    the fourth lifetime Israel would come out.
</p>
<p>
    This interpretation allows each of the dozen details in Genesis 15:12-16 to
    be taken at face value, in their normal meaning. It completely upholds the
    principle of inerrancy. God had promised the affliction would end at a
    certain time and that the outcome would be marvelous. Under this
    interpretation the end of Israel's servitude in Egypt would come in just
    four lifetimes.
</p>
<h4>
    Accepting the Witness of God
</h4>
<p>
    God Himself is the first speaker in Scripture to address the years of
    sojourn in Egypt. He said Abraham's descendants would be afflicted in a
    land that was not theirs. Nearly all acknowledge this to be referring to
    Egypt. He said affliction in that land would continue for 400 years. Since
    400 years is clearly more than 215-years, God's statement eliminates the
    traditional 215-year view. While the 215-year folks quickly fall back to
    Moses statement about Israel's stay in Egypt in Exodus 12:40, we will show
    next that Moses statement does not support their view either.
</p>
<p>
    Some see God's 400 year statement and Moses 430-year statement as a
    conflict and then imply that it is impossible to know for sure what is
    being said. This conflict is resolved once one recalls that Moses was
    talking about Israel's total time in Egypt which began with welcome, while
    God was speaking about the portion of time in Egypt after the welcome wore
    off and was characterized by affliction. The number 400 is also more
    general and could suggest that the time of affliction was introduced over a
    period of time. God's statement agrees with Moses' 430-years statement but
    rejects a 215-year Egyptian stay.
</p>
<p>
    God is not only the first speaker in Scripture to address the issue but He
    is speaking specifically about the length of time in Egypt. Further, He is
    the most important speaker in all of Scripture. In just five words, the
    first five words of Scripture, "In the beginning God created," He settled
    the creation/evolution issue. Certainly in five verses He could settle the
    215/430-year issue. As we shall soon see, the position of the traditional
    view only seems to worsen.
</p>
<h3>
    B. The Witness of Moses-Exodus 12:40-41
</h3>
<p>
    So, how does Moses weigh in on the subject? After all, he was there. Under
    the LORD he led Israel out of Egypt. Maybe we have missed something, but
    his words seem clear. In Exodus 12:40-41 he states:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>40</sup>
    <strong>
The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years.        <sup>41</sup>At the end of 430-years, on that very day, all the hosts
        of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Hebrew text of verse forty was not always clear. In the days of Sir
    Isaac Newton, Archbishop James Ussher, and the translation of the King
    James Version there were long standing questions about the text. The
    Septuagint gave the translation "lived in Egypt and Canaan." Josephus took
    that view. As a result the nearly universal view of Christians 400 years
    ago was that the 430-year sojourn included both the years in Canaan and in
    Egypt. This is where the idea came from that 215 of the 430-year sojourn
    were spent in Canaan by Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Newton, Ussher and the
    King James translators were all products of their age and expressed the
    understanding of their day.
</p>
<p>
    Over the next two centuries textual scholars worked to resolve the
    difficulties with the text. By the late 1800's Robert Jamieson of the six
    volume Jamieson-Fausset-Brown commentary series could say that hardly any
    Hebrew scholar of eminence still accepted the corrupted text that allowed
    for understanding that the 430-years spanned the time Abraham and his
descendants lived in the Promised Land and in Egypt.    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Today even those few
    eminent Hebraists are history. Only the incorrect translation of 1611 and
    its successors remain to uphold the faulty interpretation. Those who still
    teach that Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years reject hundreds of
    years of work to determine the correct text. Today's translations such as
    the ESV used in this book (Exodus 12:40 cited above) clearly state that
    Israel sojourned in Egypt 430-years.
</p>
<p>
    Many have unwittingly clung to the incorrect view of Newton and Ussher's
    day. What are the authorities saying today? US career missionary to Israel
    [Bill Rogers-over 20 years in Israel and now with Operation Mobilization]
    answered our question about what people in Israel believe about the years
    in Egypt as follows:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Regarding the 430-years, I have never even heard that this was in
        question, as it is accepted universally by Jewish scholars and most
        evangelicals too (I thought). The period of time began when Jacob went
        to Egypt at the end of his life. The Bible is also very clear when God
        said "your descendants" will be strangers for 430 [sic, 400] years. It
        is a no brainer to me. Of course I realize that there are all kinds of
        higher criticism people who question all of the Bible chronology,
        including the timing of the Exodus, but again it seems to me that the
        Bible is the final authority and speaks quite clearly on the subject of
        timing
    </strong>
    .<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Since the subject is Jewish history, it would seem that of all people
    living today, Jews would have the most accurate understanding of their
    history.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. C.F. Keil, co-author of the authoritative 25-volume commentary on the
Hebrew text of the Old Testament,    <em>Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament,</em> writes as follows about
    Israel's time in Egypt:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
The sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt had lasted 430-years.        <u>This number is not critically doubtful</u>, nor are the 430-years to
        be reduced to 215 by an arbitrary interpolation, such as we find in the
        LXX [Septuagint]
    </strong>
.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>    <strong>(Emphasis ours.)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    "Not critically doubtful" means that Hebrew biblical scholars find no
    substantial reason to question 430-years in Egypt . Dr. Keil acknowledges
    that lesser texts contain "arbitrary interpolations" such as the LXX which
    reduces this number by adding the interpolation "and Canaan," but that all
    such interpolations should be ignored. They have no bearing on the Hebrew
    text. Dr. Keil wrote his commentary over a century ago.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Thomas Constable, Professor of Bible at Dallas Theological Seminary for
    45 years and author of the vast web site, soniclight.com with over 8000
    pages of expository notes covering all the books of the Old and New
    Testament writes this succinct statement:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <u>The text is very clear</u>
        that Israel was in Egypt 430-years "to the very day."
    </strong>
    <sup> <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> </sup>
    <strong>(Emphasis ours.)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    So not only God Himself but also Moses, the greatest instrument of God in
    producing the Old Testament, testifies to many more than 215-years in
    Egypt.
</p>
<h3>
    C. The Witness of Stephen-Acts 7
</h3>
<p>
    God's revelation in Genesis 15 was given to Abraham 4000 years ago. Moses'
    record in Exodus was prepared 3400 years ago. Long after the words of God
    and Moses, the New Testament also spoke to the years in Egypt. The church's
    first martyr, Stephen, before being stoned, declared:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    <strong>
        And God spoke to this effect-that his [Abraham's] offspring would be
        sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and
        afflict them four hundred years. <sup>7</sup>"But I will judge the
        nation that they serve," said God, "and after that they shall come out
        and worship me in this place." Acts 7:6-7.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Stephen, "a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit," (Acts 6:5) was
    citing God's words to Abraham in Genesis 15:13-14. The common elements
    agree-the subject is Abraham's descendants who would be living as aliens in
    a land God had not promised them; they would be enslaved and this
    affliction would last 400 years. Stephen unwittingly disclosed that in 2000
    years the belief of Jewry had not changed. After all that time they still
    understood God to be saying that the sojourn in Egypt would involve 400
    years of affliction.
</p>
<p>
    We have already seen how the traditional view feels compelled to find other
    explanations for God's seemingly clear words to Abraham in Genesis 15. But
    reinterpreting Stephen's words to mean something else would be very
    difficult. So, what does the traditional view do with Stephen's testimony?
    They say Acts 7 is exactly what he said. Then they add that inerrancy only
    guarantees what a person says, not the accuracy of what is said. They say
    that this man whom Scripture says was full of the Holy Spirit misspoke. He
    was under pressure and/or was confused, so his words cannot necessarily be
    accepted as factual. On the contrary, Stephen must be added to the
    witnesses to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. Now three consecutive witnesses
    in Scripture testify to the larger sojourn number.
</p>
<h3>
    D. The Witness of Paul-Galatians 3:17
</h3>
<p>
    While Stephen is the New Testament witness to the 400-year number God gave
    to Abraham, the Apostle Paul is the New Testament witness to the 430-year
    number given by Moses:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        This is what I mean: the law, which came 430-years afterward, does not
        annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise
        void. Galatians 3:17.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Without question this is the traditional view's favorite verse. "Here is
    absolute proof" they say, "that the 430-years began when God first appeared
    to Abraham and ended with the Exodus." They say God made the promises of
    Genesis 12:1-3 to Abraham when he was living in Haran. He immediately
    obeyed God's call and moved to Canaan. Then 430-years later the law was
    given at the time of the Exodus. Therefore the 430-years began when Abraham
    moved to Canaan and ended with the Exodus. The 430-years consisted of the
    years of sojourning in Canaan plus those in Egypt. Since Abraham, Isaac and
    Jacob sojourned in Canaan 215-years, the remaining 215-years was the time
    of sojourning in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    The traditional view cites Paul's authority. Because he wrote more of the
    New Testament than any other writer and his books contain the heart of
    Christian doctrine, he outranks all other writers of Scripture. If there is
    some confusion between the Old Testament and the Apostle, one must prefer
    the Apostle. They suggest that possibly the Old Testament isn't clear, but
    the Apostle is perfectly clear and he is the final authority. Thus the
    traditional view stands with the Apostle-the entire sojourn in Canaan and
    Egypt lasted 430-years, period, end of discussion.
</p>
<p>
    When this view leads the discussion, it doesn't start with the very words
    of the LORD Himself in Genesis 15, but immediately starts with Galatians
    3:17 and then reinterprets the words of Stephen, Moses and Jehovah to agree
    with Paul. But which is better: to start with the primary sources, Jehovah
    and Moses, then work to the secondary sources in the New Testament, or
    start with one secondary source, work on the other secondary source and
    then rework the primary sources?
</p>
<h4>
    Reconciling Paul with God, Moses and Stephen
</h4>
<p>
    Nevertheless, every knowing Christian takes very seriously what the Apostle
    wrote. What, then, are we to do with Paul's words? First we should observe
    that the subject of both God and of Moses was the number of years in Egypt;
    Stephen and Paul were addressing other subjects. Stephen's point was that
    Israel's leaders historically rejected God's messengers. So he specifically
    quoted God's words to Abraham as he reminded his hearers that God had
    raised up the nation to sovereignly accomplish His will even though His
    will was constantly resisted.
</p>
<p>
    Paul, like Stephen, was not discussing how many years Israel sojourned in
    Egypt. He was showing that God's grace preceded God's Law. In his argument
    He cited a number every Jew would know-the 430-year number. It was repeated
    annually in the Passover celebration. Paul's point was that the Law did not
    finally make a way for man to have a right relationship with God. God dealt
    with the forefathers of Israel in grace from the beginning, long before the
    law. That grace is seen in the promises and covenant God gave to Abraham,
    Isaac and Jacob. All this promise/covenant development happened 430-years
    before God gave Israel the Law.
</p>
<p>
    If there was no standing before God until the Law, the promises were
    meaningless and all the Jewish people who lived before the giving of the
    law missed out on a right relationship with God. The 430-year number was a
    powerful argument for grace rather than law. Yet the Galatian believers
    were being told that they needed to keep the Mosaic Law to enjoy God's
    blessings. So, Paul argued that God established promises and a covenant
    with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Then 430-years later He gave the Law. In
    this way, Paul agrees with God, Moses and Stephen in supporting 430-years
    in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    It should also be noted that since God's and Moses' core subject was the
    time in Egypt while Stephen's and Paul's core subjects were other matters,
    God and Moses should be preferred over Stephen and Paul. But since
    Stephen's words agree with God's words, only Paul can be viewed to be at
    odds with the other three. Rather than working on the words of the other
    three witnesses, many of which are not subject to another interpretation,
    shouldn't the first consideration be, "Can Paul's rather general words can
    be understood in another light?"
</p>
<p>
    Proceeding on that basis-one insight would be Paul's reference to covenant.
    God did not give Abraham a covenant when He called him. The covenant was
    not made until Abraham had been in the land about ten years-shortly before
    Abraham took Hagar to give Sarah a child. If Paul were talking about the
    time from the Covenant to the Law, he should have said 420 years, not
    430-years. On the other hand if the call came to Abraham when he was living
    in Ur, not when his father died in Haran, then the time from the call to
    the Law would have been greater than 430-years. (The next chapter shows
    that the call came in Ur, not Haran.)
</p>
<p>
    But Paul is not speaking about Abraham's call. He is speaking about the
    promises which foreshadow Jesus Christ and the salvation God would provide
    through Him. These promises were amplified over time to Abraham, then to
    his son Isaac and finally to his grandson Jacob. They were sworn to by God
    Himself in the covenant of Genesis 15.
</p>
<p>
    Joseph invited his father to move to Egypt where there was food because
    five years of famine remained. Jacob accepted. He took his household as far
    as Beersheba in Southern Israel, but then he hesitated. Previously it had
    not been God's will for him, his father or grandfather to leave the
    Promised Land. Jacob offered sacrifices. In a vision God gave him assurance
    to continue to Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>1</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        So Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba,
        and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. <sup> 2</sup>And
        God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, "Jacob, Jacob."
        And he said, "Here I am." <sup>3</sup>Then he said, "I am God, the God
        of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will
        make you into a great nation. <sup>4</sup>I myself will go down with
        you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph's hand
        shall close your eyes." Genesis 46:1-4.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In this passage God restates and amplifies the promises for the final time
    before the sojourn in Egypt. On this night the promise-making period that
    began with God's call to Abraham concluded; the next day Jacob moved his
    people to Egypt. So the promises were given, restated and expanded over
    more than 215-years. After the promises (this promise-making period) came
    the 430-year sojourn in Egypt. Following this came the giving of the Law at
    Mount Sinai. Thus sandwiched in between the development of the promises and
    the giving of the Law were those 430-years in Egypt. First came years of
    making the promises/covenant. Then came the 430-year sojourn in Egypt.
    Following that God gave Israel the Law at Mount Sinai. Thus, from the [end
    of the] promise and covenant making period to the law was precisely
    430-years. Paul was not contradicting the words of Moses but was actually
    confirming them. This interpretation fits perfectly with the testimonies of
    the other three witnesses.
</p>
<p>
    So which is better? To make Paul's words of a very general nature to agree
    with the specific words of the other three witnesses or to make all the
    words of the three witnesses agree with one interpretation of when the
    430-years in Paul's statement began? Logically, the first approach seems
    preferable. Thus, it is sound hermeneutics to understand that Paul's words
    agree with those of God, Moses and Stephen. The New Testament confirms the
    words of God in Stephen's message to the leaders of Israel and the words of
    Moses in Paul's argument to the Galatians. In contrast to the traditional
    215-year view, the Bible gives no less than four passages to emphasize that
    it was 430-years that Israel sojourned in Egypt. All the statements and
    numbers in these four passages are harmonized without conflict. Inerrancy
    is honored.
</p>
<h4>
    Path to Violating Scripture
</h4>
<p>
    In retrospect, where did the practice of preferring numbers to words begin?
    As stated in the previous chapter, it all began when people, thinking they
    were taking the Bible literally, added the numbers in Levi's line and
    realized that Amram could not possibly be the immediate father of Aaron if
    Israel were in Egypt 430-years. They eventually concluded the 430-years
    referred to the entire time from Abraham's arrival in Canaan until the
    Exodus. That left just 215-years in Egypt. It was possible for Amram to be
    the immediate father of Aaron if Israel were in Egypt just 215-years. But
    unfortunately the obvious meaning of many other words of Scripture would
    need to be reinterpreted in difficult and unnatural ways.
</p>
<p>
    Why do all that to Scripture when it is clear that Hebrew genealogies can
    be as narrow as Adam begetting Cain or as broad as Jesus being the son of
    David? When one recognizes the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies,
    the record of Amram begetting Aaron is obviously a skipping of multiple
    generations. It is the broad sense of Amram being a forefather of Aaron, of
    Aaron coming from the loins of Amram. Once this is understood, the
    Scriptures become whole, no contradictions, no errors, no explaining away
    clear verses, no ignoring difficult verses.
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion Number One: Israel Dwelt in Egypt 430-years
</h4>
<p>
    The debate over whether Israel dwelt in Egypt 430 or 215-years is not
    between those who accept the Bible and those who question the Bible. Both
    sides believe the Bible is inerrant and the final authority. Motive
    distinguishes the two positions. 430-years didn't work with an uninformed
    view of the genealogies, so long ago the traditional view found a way to
    cut the 430-years down to 215. Today, the typical Evangelical Christian has
    never heard the 215-year view taught or even talked about. When he reads
    about those who reduce the 430-year Egyptian sojourn, he is shocked. He
    asks, "How could anyone who claims to honor Scripture treat it with such
    callousness?"
</p>
<p>
    He might even reexamine what Scripture actually says and find that four
    authors address the subject. The first author is no less than God Himself
    who promised to make Abraham a great nation but warned that the path to
    nationhood would involve exploitation and servitude. To give hope God
    revealed that difficult time would end in 400 years. Centuries later Moses
    wrote a description of the deliverance from Egypt and said that the
    deliverance came 430-years to the day after Israel went down to Egypt.
    While God's 400 years only spoke about the affliction time in Egypt, he
    would realize that Moses' 430-years referred to the entire time in Egypt
    which included a period at the beginning when Jacob's family was given good
    land and was not afflicted. Thus, the two periods, 400 and 430, were
    actually the overall period and then a period within the overall period.
    They were true periods, each supporting the other. Thus, no less than God
    and Moses attested to 430-years in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    He comes to the New Testament which states both the 400 year and 430-year
    numbers. Stephen rehearsed Israel's history and quoted God's statement
    about 400 years of affliction in a land belonging to others while Paul
    cited Moses 430-year statement as the time from the making of promises and
    covenant to the giving of the Mosaic Law during the first year of
    wilderness wandering. Thus he finds that both the Old and New Testaments
    attest to 430-years in Egypt. With his study completed, he concludes,
    "Certainly the testimony of these authorities should be adequate. If not,
    how can a Christian trust anything Scripture says?"
</p>
<p>
    Motivation also tests the two interpretations. True motivation attempts to
    determine what the passages in question say. The 430 view is motivated by
    this desire while the 215 view is motivated by a desire to reduce the
    430-years in some way. If there are compelling reasons to understand a
    passage in some other way than its normal meaning, it may be necessary to
    explore the subject passages in unconventional ways. But if not, such
    tampering must be avoided. The 215-year view has no such compelling reason.
    Four hundred thirty years is not harmful to Scripture. Instead, it is
    beneficial because it forces the interpreter to take the genealogies as
    they were meant to be taken. Finally, while four authors support the
    430-year number, nowhere does a single author of Scripture suggest or imply
    Israel was in Egypt only 215-years.
</p>
<p>
    While trying to avoid being dogmatic, we are stating what appears to most
    to be obvious. It appears that beyond question Israel's sojourn in Egypt
    lasted 430-years. To say otherwise is to teach something the Scripture
    simply never says and to deny what the Scripture says multiple times. Two
    hundred fifteen and years dishonors Scripture. It is not the way that
    inerrancy treats Scripture. Once a person has a clear understanding of the
    four witnesses' testimonies, a 430-year sojourn in Egypt can no longer be
    disputed.
</p>
<p>
    This 430-year number is like a brick wall. All those who throw themselves
    against it only injure themselves while the wall stands. Hopefully they
    will give glory to God who has revealed clearly a 430-year sojourn in Egypt
    and abandon this longstanding distraction.
</p>
<p>
    A 430-year Egyptian sojourn would seemingly push Ussher's date for the
    Flood back 215-years, from 2348 BC to 2563 BC (in truth it doesn't because
    of other errors). This will make the historians and archaeologists a little
    happier since they find much human activity during that span. However, if
    the people who emphasize numbers over words in Scripture have made other
    errors in their calculations, the 2563 BC number will need further
    correcting.
</p>
<h4>
    Conclusion Number Two: Genealogies May be Abbreviated
</h4>
<p>
    Chapter one showed that a 430-year sojourn in Egypt would require
    understanding that the Levi-Aaron line of Exodus chapter six was
    abbreviated. This chapter shows that beyond doubt Israel did sojourn in
    Egypt 430-years. These two facts raise two alternatives: either the Bible
    is in error at this point or the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated. The
    first alternative is both unacceptable and unnecessary. Therefore, the only
    other alternative must be accepted: their genealogy is selective rather
    than comprehensive.
</p>
<p>
    Such a conclusion is a stumbling block to some. But it need not be. When
    they examine the many ways Scripture uses genealogies, they will realize
    that Exodus six acceptably and accurately uses Hebrew genealogies. This
    insight will be a momentous advance for those who cherish Scripture as
    God-breathed.
</p>
<h4>
    Looking Ahead
</h4>
<p>
    God, Moses, Stephen, Paul-four witnesses. Are four enough? In Deuteronomy
    17:6 the very life of a person rested in the hands of just two or three
    witnesses. If someone turned to idolatry God said to put them to death on
    the evidence of two or three witnesses. This principle regarding the
    required number of witnesses to establish a fact carried through to the New
    Testament church. Paul said that two or three witnesses were necessary to
    establish a charge against an elder (I Timothy 5:19). The testimony of four
    witnesses more than meets the biblical requirement for establishing the
    truth.
</p>
<p>
    Having established by four witnesses that Israel dwelt in Egypt 430-years
    and therefore the Levi-Aaron genealogy of Exodus six is abbreviated, our
    initial goal has been reached. While we could end here, some may still
    believe Abraham's call came in Haran and therefore three witness for
    430-years while one witnesses for 215-years. We will next examine extensive
    evidence for that call coming in Ur, not Haran, leaving all four witnesses
    solidly in the 430-year Egyptian sojourn camp. Then we will take a careful
    look at Jacob's life to correct details which have also been altered to fit
    the numbers over words approach. In effect this book provides a fresh look
    at some of the key moments in the lives of Abraham and Jacob, a prize for
    those wanting to correct mistaken notions regarding aspects of their lives.
</p>
<p>
    Once these interpretations are addressed, we can get to the heart of this
    paper, a look at the nature and function of Hebrew genealogies. Chapter
    five addresses how family relationship words can be used in both narrow and
    broad senses; chapter six gives numerous examples of condensed genealogies
    and chapter seven provides many evidences for Shem's line (Genesis 11)
    being condensed. And so it goes. Hold on to your hats. We have just begun.
