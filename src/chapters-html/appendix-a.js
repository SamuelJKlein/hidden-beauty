    <em>Solving the Problem of Flood Dates that Are Too Late</em>

    <em>
        The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies: Harmonizing Old Testament
        Words and Numbers
    </em>
    studies the Scriptural use, records and context of Hebrew genealogies as
    they relate to the date of the Flood. The key issue is whether Hebrew
    genealogies are abbreviated, how frequently and under what circumstances.
    The first four chapters are needed just to present an open/shut case for
    the condensing of the Levi-Aaron list of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The
    approach of the book is to observe what the inerrant Scriptures themselves
    say and then draw conclusions from those observations which the reader can
    weigh. It is not a survey of what others have said. That must be left to
    others. It concludes that 35-55 generations are omitted between Eber and
    Peleg (E&amp;P) and that the Flood happened 1500 to 2100 years earlier than
    generally understood.
</p>
<p>
    This book is long because so many issues cloud the subject-from the nature
    of Hebrew genealogies to the lives of the Patriarchs to the accuracy of the
    existing text through history and on and on. Both little known and even new
    thoughts are found throughout the reading. Below is a summary of the book's
    findings, but their support will only be discovered through the reading of
    the entire book. They are listed in the order of the most relevant findings
    to the conclusion of the book. Upon completing the book, it should be clear
    whether its conclusion is reasonably supported.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        1. The gradual decrease of longevity after the Flood with one exception
    </strong>
    . Human longevity slowly decreased after the Flood from 438 to 70 years. In
    Shem's record of Genesis 11 the decline between the first and second names
    was five years and between the fourth and sixth names was 4.5 years per
    generation. This gradual decline continued until Moses' day at rates as
    high as seven or eight years per generation with one exception. The decline
    between the third and fourth names was 225 years or 61% of the total
    368-year decline. While it appears to come between two otherwise
    straight-forward consecutive generations, it is the clue to the omission of
    many, many generations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. An immediate halving of Post-Flood Lifespans</strong>
    . While this study concludes that the decline between Eber and Peleg was
    the result of omitting an estimated 35-55 generations, it must be
    distinguished from the immediate halving of post-Flood lifespans. Scripture
    records that those who lived and died before the Flood all lived about 900
    years. Without exception all eight listed names lived about that long. Yet
    the first three generations born after the Flood lived just half as long.
    These are facts declared by Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        3. Recognizing a sufficient cause for the immediate halving.
    </strong>
    What caused the immediate halving? Recognizing the Flood's unimaginable
    violence triggers the solution. Twice God spoke of the Flood destroying the
    earth (Genesis 6:13; 9:11). The planet remained but its crust was wracked
    by forces beyond comprehension. After this violence the reproductive
    genetics of all on the Ark could only produce progeny living half as long
    as those who lived and died before the Flood. Longevity charts of the past
    included Noah and Shem. They were born with pre-Flood genetics, but they
    lived after the Flood as well so they are exceptions. Consequently, they
    cannot be used to determine longevity declines.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. The misguided chrono-genealogy interpretation</strong>
    . Some suggest that the numbers when each father had his son in Genesis 11
    establish a chronology and even if there are omitted names, the number
    marks the years until the next named son. The issue here is how to treat
    details about the parents preceding an omitted name. That issue is solved
    with the Levi genealogy of Exodus 6 and Numbers 26. The names involved are
    Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. Names are omitted between Amram and Aaron. Six
    details are given about Amram's wife-her name, her father (Levi), her
    country of birth, etc. They are true of the mother of Amram's unnamed son,
not Aaron who was born 300 years after Amram. Chapter one of    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> spells this out in careful detail. The omission of
    names between Amram and Aaron is indisputable.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. The purpose of the begat numbers</strong>
    . Chrono-genealogy advocates support their argument by saying the purpose
    for giving each father's age when he begat his heir in Genesis 11 is to
    provide a timeline of history. Yet nowhere does Scripture state this or any
    other purpose for providing those numbers. If Moses summed them or if they
    were summed elsewhere in Scripture, we would know beyond doubt that they
    were provided to be summed. Elsewhere Scripture provides critical numbers
    and even sums entire periods of time: lifespans of Abraham, Isaac and
    Jacob; 430- year sojourn in Egypt; 480-year period between the Exodus and
    the Temple. It might be argued that the silence of Scripture is an argument
    from silence and could just as easily be used for adding those numbers. But
    on the face of it, which is more likely-that the numbers were not added
    because they would give the wrong answer or that they were not added
    because the reader was expected to add them?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Israel's sojourn in Egypt: 430, not 215-years.</strong>
    Of all the dates for the Flood determined by summing the numbers of Shem's
    list, the 2348 BC date published in 1650 by Archbishop James Ussher is the
    best known. Ussher was a first-rate Bible scholar but he was limited to the
    sources of his day and they contained multiple errors, especially a textual
    problem in Exodus 12:40. As a result, like most before him he understood
    Moses' words to support a 215-year Egyptian sojourn. Two hundred years
    after Ussher's death the textual problem was finally solved. Today, nearly
    every modern English Bible reads "The time that the people of Israel lived
    in Egypt was 430-years." But all along Scripture had provided four
    witnesses to a 430-year sojourn in Egypt: God (Genesis 15:16), Moses
    (Exodus 12:40), Stephen (Acts 7:6) and Paul (Galatians 3:17).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7. Questionable Scriptural Interpretations</strong>
    . Numerous unreasonable interpretations and even contradictions appear when
Shem's genealogy is viewed as complete. In chapter 15    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> lists around 45 that were identified and corrected
    in the preceding chapters and it certainly did not find them all. These
    difficulties disappear when the Bible student acknowledges the omission of
    35-55 names.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8. The practice of condensing Hebrew genealogies</strong>
    . It is a fact that Old Testament genealogies, at times, are abbreviated.
    It was a Hebrew practice. <em>Hidden Beauty</em> gives 16 examples in
    chapters six and seven. Even the line from Perez to David was shrunk by
    about 2/3<sup>rds </sup>in Ruth 4 (ten names instead of an estimated 27-30)
    and repeated in exactly the same order in I Chronicles 2, Matthew 1 and
    Luke 3. Intentionally condensing Shem's genealogy was consistent with
    Hebrew practice.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. The simplicity of Hebrew family terms.</strong>
    The nature of Hebrew kinship terms makes abbreviating genealogies possible.
    Hebrews used simple words for family relationships. "Son" could refer to a
    father's immediate male offspring, his grandson or even a distant
    descendant. Matthew 1:1 uses "son" in this very way: "Jesus Christ, the son
    of David." Even the verb "to bear, to beget" was used in this way. This
    simplicity allowed much flexibility in expressing relationships based on
    birth. It allowed for brevity. A long list could be shortened to just the
    tribe, clan and family before naming the individual. The primary purpose of
    Hebrew lists was to identify ancestors with descendants and descendants
    with ancestors. Therefore, in most cases a complete list was at the
    discretion of the author.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>10. The biblical pattern of condensed genealogies</strong>
    . Scripture (often) follows a pattern when generations are skipped and
    Shem's list follows this pattern-the gap comes after three consecutive
    names. When more time is covered, lists contain more structure. The
    following examples work from the simplest structure to the most extensive.
    The purpose of omitting names was efficiency. Why trouble the reader with
    numerous unknown people when it was unnecessary? Various clues often help
    to estimate how many generations were omitted.
</p>
<p>
    Aaron's list began with the typical three names and ends with his:
    Levi-Kohath-Amram-(an 8 to 12 generation gap)-Aaron. Korah who challenged
    Aaron's leadership and Dathan and Abiram, who challenged Moses' leadership,
    follow the pattern of Aaron's list: Levi-Kohath-Izhar-(an 8 to 12
    generation gap)-Korah; Reuben-Pallu-Eliab-(a 9 to 13 generation gap)-Dathan
    and Abiram. For clarity the structure may also include the father or even
    the grandfather of the individual: Judah (tribe)-Zerah (clan)-Zabdi
    (family)-(a 10 to 14 generation gap)-Carmi (father)-Achan. The Judah-David
    list covers 900 years so it contains more structure. It consists of ten
    names in three groups of three consecutive names separated by two gaps and
    concludes with David: Perez (son of Judah)-Hezron-Ram-gap of 8 to 10
    generations; Amminadab-Nashon-Salmon-gap of 9 to 11 generations;
    Boaz-Obed-Jesse (third set of three consecutive names)-David.
</p>
<p>
    Shem's list covers about 2000 years and follows the structure of David's
    list. It consists of ten names beginning with the patriarch Shem followed
    by three groups of three names. Group one consists of the first three
    generations born after the Flood. Group two consists of the three names
    immediately following the 35-55 generation gap. Group three consists of the
    three names of Abraham's immediate family: his grandfather, father and
    himself. It is possible that a small gap exists between the second and
    third sets of names. Here is the pattern: Shem (born before the Flood);
    Arpachshad-Shelah-Eber-35 to 55 generation gap; Peleg-Reu-Serug-a possible
    brief gap of up to six names; Nahor-Terah-Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>11. The meaning of Peleg's name</strong>
    . A strong argument for the late Flood date has been that Peleg's name
    means "to divide" and that he was given this name because shortly before
    his birth God divided the human race by languages at the Tower of Babel
    judgment. Summing the years indicates he was born 101 years after the
    Flood. Since four generations is reasonable for 101 years, this argument
    concludes that no names are missing. Language scholar and Hebrew professor
    Bernard E Northrup (1925-2008) observed that Peleg's name meant "divided by
    water," not merely "to divide." He got this meaning from an extensive study
    of the Hebrew words formed from the root of Peleg's name (PLG). Of the 17
    times the noun is found in the Old Testament, Strong found it meant stream
    or river ten times (Strong word number 6378) and the son of Eber seven
    times (word #6379). Rivers and streams obviously divide things.
</p>
<p>
    In a broader search, whether Northrup looked at Hebrew PLG words in their
    other parts of speech, PLG words in related Semitic languages and even PLG
    words in unrelated languages, those three letters often had something to do
    with water or a division related to water. Northrup found 18 such PLG words
    associated with water in classical Greek alone. Even in English he found
    PLG words associated with water: pelagic depths and archipelago. While he
    believed the division was caused by the breakup of the super continent,
    current thinking points to Ice Age melt raising sea level to increase open
    water distances between continents and islands. Peleg meaning "divided by
    water" would place his birth at the end of the Ice Age, over 1000 years
    after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>12. Too little time between the Flood and Babel</strong>
    . If the Babel judgment did occur just 101 years after the Flood, not
    enough workers would have been available to build the city and part of the
    tower. <em>Hidden Beauty</em> shows there would have been fewer than 100.
    This time argument is another strike against saying Peleg's name marks the
    date when God stopped man from building the Tower of Babel by dividing his
    speech. Actually, the text seems to grant the latitude of his entire
    lifespan. Since God's judgment at Babel was an immediate act, a process
    such as the final period of the Ice Age melt is a better fit for the
    meaning of Peleg's name.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>13. The larger numbers in the Septuagint (LXX)</strong>
    . Depending on versions, the LXX reports up to 900 more years in the Shem
    line than the Masoretic Text (MT), placing the Flood up to a millennium
    earlier than Ussher's 2348 BC date. The LXX formed as follows: about 250 BC
    Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt requested that Jewish scholars from
    Jerusalem translate their Hebrew Torah into Greek for his growing library.
    These scribes had different Hebrew texts to choose from. This fact was
    unknown until recently as scholars discovered through exhaustive studies of
    the biblical Dead Sea Scrolls that they fall into different textual groups.
    Why would the scribes choose from a textual group with larger numbers
    unless there was a sense that the Flood was earlier than a summing of MT
    numbers indicated? Further, the larger numbers of the LXX entered the
    Hebrew textual tradition well before 250 BC. Even further, the LXX was the
    Old Testament of Christians for a thousand years. Today, some creation
    scientists accept these larger numbers because they are convinced of an
    earlier Flood date. The existence of the LXX shows that even before 250 BC
    some Jews preferred an earlier date for the Flood and this alerts today's
    students to watch for the possibility of more time as they study Shem's
    list in the MT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>14. The context of the Book of Job</strong>
    . Before Northrup's career change that led to teaching Hebrew for 45 years
    (point #11), he trained to be a geologist. During his teaching career he
    assisted Bible translators in foreign countries. Due to his faith that
    God's works (geology) would agree with His Word (the Bible) during his
    travels he visited and studied more geological sites than many career
    geologists. He was speaking at a conference in 1971 when it struck him that
    the Book of Job was an Ice Age book. Since the Ice Age was previously
    poorly understood, it is not surprising that expositors did not recognize
    the 15 or so different kinds of Ice Age phenomena Northrup observed in Job.
</p>
<p>
    Expositors generally missed that God in His creation discourse (Job 38-41)
    was establishing an extended record of the marvelous nature of His creation
    which showed His love for mankind and Job. Due to evolution, they also
    misidentified the dinosaur God described as the long-necked, long-tailed
    Behemoth of Job 40. Further, they missed the true identity of the only
    creature specifically named in the creation account and elaborated on by
    its Creator Himself in Job 41 with as many verses as the entire creation
    account of Genesis 1:1-2:3. Finally, they failed to see that God's true
    purpose in allowing Job's suffering was to establish at the earliest
    opportunity the malicious intent of Satan towards humanity as portrayed in
    the sea monster and Job 1-2. Ice Age phenomena and Jordan's dinosaurs were
gone by the time Abraham entered Canaan 500 years later.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> spends three chapters on the antiquity of the book
    of Job which shouts that Shem's list omits many generations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>15. Job's 280-year lifespan</strong>
    . How long did Job live? Simple logic applied to the clear statements of
    Scripture provides the answer. First, Scripture established a truth: "The
    LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before" (Job 42:10) and "The LORD
    blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning" (Job 42:12). The
    passage speaks of three categories of blessing: livestock, family and
    years. Since his first livestock were lost forever, God indeed gave him
    twice as many as before. But since his first ten children were in heaven,
    he received just ten more, so that in heaven he truly would have twice as
    many. As to his years before the ordeal, he still had those experiences of
    walking with the LORD and building a ranching empire. They were like his
    children so he would only need 140 more to double them to 280. By
    comparison Peleg lived 239 years. The decline of longevity was 4-5 years
    per generation at that point so Job's 280 years places his birth 8-9
generations before Peleg or about 2675 BC. If Shem's list is not shortened    <strong>before</strong> Peleg, Job would have been born before the Flood
    which is impossible. Job's 280-year lifespan may be a radically new idea to
    the reader and take some deep thinking to accept but the logic of animals
    vs children and the early context of the book support it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        16. The symmetrical Lists of Adam, Shem, Terah, Perez and Gospel of
        Matthew
    </strong>
    . Shem's genealogy (Genesis 11:10-22) follows a pattern of structuring-ten
    names in it (Shem-Abraham) to balance the ten from creation to the Flood
    (Adam-Noah, Genesis 5). Meredith Kline of covenant theology fame sees a
    third set of ten names in Terah's extended family. Genesis 11:27-30 lists
    eight names while grandsons, Ishmael and Isaac, are found later in Genesis.
    He scores points on this idea by observing that Iscah, an otherwise obscure
    granddaughter is named solely to bring the number to ten. The Perez-David
    list of Ruth 4 also contains 10 names while omitting as many as 21 and is
    found in I Chronicles, Matthew and Luke. Matthew's genealogy of Christ is
    also structured-three sets of double sevens stretching from Abraham to
    Christ.
</p>
<p>
    The structuring of lists reflects the Hebrews' love for certain numbers.
    Ten and seven were among the most favored. Whether a genealogical list or
    simply a listing of an extended family as in the case of Terah, those
    favored numbers are found in five associated lists. How could five
    perfectly balanced lists containing over 100 names come about by chance?
    The odds must be great. More likely the authors under divine guidance
    structured them. While structuring does not demand omitting names, it
    raises a substantial possibility. Some inerrancy Evangelicals lay a lot of
    stock in biblical numbers and greatly appreciate this point.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>17. The awkward overlapping of lives</strong>
    . If Shem's list is not abbreviated between <strong>E&amp;P</strong>,
    according to the numbers found in Scripture, Shem who was born before the
    Flood would have outlived seven of the first eight generations born after
    the Flood; the first three fathers born in the new world, Arpachshad,
    Shelah and Eber, would have outlived many generations born after them; and
    Shem's great grandson Eber would have outlived the next five generations
    after him. In contrast this extreme overlapping is not found after Eber in
    the biblical numbers. Why would these first three generations be immune to
    whatever reduced the years of their immediate descendants by half and more?
    Considering how Hebrews handled their genealogies provides the answer.
    Shem's line is compressed. Many generations were born between Eber and
    Peleg so those first three fathers died over a millennium before Peleg and
    the names that follow.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>18. Damage to the credibility of creation scientists. </strong>
    Creation science is an admirable movement. In it are those who have risked
    reputations and even careers as they point to scientific evidence that
    supports biblical creation and a global Flood. But a Flood date that is
    late by a thousand years or more is also associated with this movement and
    unfortunately raises a question over the credibility of the science of
    creation scientists as well. By understanding how Hebrew genealogies work,
    those holding the late Flood date can correct their error and remove this
    obstacle to the acceptance of creation science.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>19.</strong>
    <strong>Non-biblical records about the first civilizations</strong>
    . Scripture reveals that the Ark survivors and their descendants quickly
    established an advanced civilization in Lower Mesopotamia. This makes sense
    since people who could build an Ark to today's dimensional standards for
    ocean-going vessels, fill it with 15,000 kinds of animal pairs that needed
    a year's worth of food and survive in it for over 365 days could certainly
    organize an advanced civilization as seen in Babel and its tower. As to the
    when of that advanced civilization, the ordeal of Job about 2550 BC
    testified that civilization already had a long history.
</p>
<p>
    These biblical facts are now confirmed in writing. In just the last 100
    years several million written documents have been unearthed in the Ancient
    Near East at numerous locations. These tablets speak of their history and
    of each other, confirming the existence of these many civilization centers
    beyond doubt. They also attest to the first civilizations. Where? You
    guessed it-in Lower Mesopotamia, precisely where Noah's descendants first
    migrated and settled. <em>Hidden Beauty's</em> finding of a 1300-1900 year
    gap between Eber and Peleg places the Flood between 3800 and 4400 BC which
    encompasses the early well-known civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt.
    What about cave men? At the same time advanced civilizations were being
    formed, settlers that migrated to regions where severe ice age conditions
    developed were reduced to hunting-gathering life styles and stone-age
    technology as they struggled to survive. Advanced civilizations and
    stone-age lifestyles existed simultaneously within 500-800 years after the
    Flood.

    <strong>
        Stop the Press/Saturday, January 15, 2022: New Evidence for Large
        Population in Saudi Arabia at the time of Job
    </strong>
    : Three days after <em>HB</em> was finally delivered for general public use
    (Wednesday, January 12, 2022), multiple stories on the Internet reported
    the discovery of vast numbers of tombs in Saudi Arabia dating between 2600
    and 2000 BC. The tombs line major routes to the north of Medina Arabia
between long-established destinations. These networks are called    <em>funerary avenues</em>. They stretch "for hundreds of kilometers and
    possibly thousands." While they are well known to local residents,
    archaeologists only recently took serious interest in them. Over the last
    year they have counted around 18,000 tombs but expect to spend years
    pursuing this new field of research and find many more.
</p>
<p>
    Walls up to six feet high surround each tomb. In aerial photographs they
    are obvious and at times tightly packed together. The tombs are either
    round or pendant in shape, and are still standing to their original height.
    "The level of preservation is unbelievable," said one archaeologist. It is
    initially thought that the occupants farmed the land nearby and their tombs
    were placed on the highway so their descendants would remember them. A
    similar custom was linked to Greece and Rome in later history. Since
    similar tombs are found in Yemen, the avenues may stretch that far. (Not in
    the news stories, but the view of this book: Why did relatives stop
    building them around 2000 BC? The Ice Age came to an end so the rain it
    delivered stopped, the population moved away and the land has been barren,
    uninhabitable desert ever since.)
</p>
<p>
    This 4,500-year-old network of highways lined with well-preserved tombs in
    Arabia joins Ebla's thousands of written documents dated between 2400 and
    2250 BC to verify that civilization was going full tilt when some teach the
    Flood occurred. Therefore, the idea found in <em>HB</em> that Moses
    followed the common Hebrew practice of omitting generations when he
    recorded Shem's list can hardly be dismissed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>20. Solving complicated problems.</strong>
    Only in modern times has the problem of a Flood date that is too late been
    widely recognized. Numerous attempts have been made to solve it, all to no
    avail because highly complicated problems require the correct solution to
    many individual issues. Yet the central solution is often elegantly simple.
    With Luther the elegant but simple solution was <em>sola scriptura</em> but
    getting there required addressing 95 issues for starters. As to this
    solution-defying problem the Church faces, the elegant solution is so
    simple-35-55 missing generations between Eber and Peleg-but this is only
    the first of many books needed to tackle the many issues it raises.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>21. Credit to Creation Scientists.</strong>
    Much credit for the findings of this book should go to creation scientists.
    Only through their research has the violence of Noah's Flood become
    apparent. This realization sparked the idea of distinguishing between the
    immediate longevity decline due to the Flood's impact on the genetics of
    man and the gradual decline between Eber and Peleg represented by just a
    single generation. If that 61% <strong>E-P</strong> longevity decline were
    immediate, a catastrophe greater than the Flood itself would have been
    needed.
