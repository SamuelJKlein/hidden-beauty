    <strong>PART IV - SHEM'S ABBREVIATED GENEALOGY CONFIRMED BY JOB</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Chapter Nine</strong>
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Evidence from the Lifespan of Job for Missing Generations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Scripture does not give Job's genealogy, but such lists are only one way to
    date an individual. The goal of this and the next two chapters is to
    showcase the many ways that do date Job. As a consequence, his life and
    times demand an earlier Flood date. The following ideas will be developed
    in these three chapters:
</p>
<p>
    1. Job lived 280 years which places his birth in the 35-55 generation gap
    between Eber and Peleg.
</p>
<p>
    2. Job lived when dinosaurs dwelt without fear of humans in the Jordan
    Valley.
</p>
<p>
    3. Job lived in the declining years of the Great Ice Age. The book contains
    15 distinct kinds of ice age phenomena.
</p>
<p>
    4. God orchestrated Job's ordeal to show mankind how malicious and
    dangerous Satan is. This message was needed early in post-Flood history.
</p>
<p>
    5. Job descended from Shem through Aram and Uz. Knowledge of God was still
    abundant in his land. A far different picture is seen in that same land in
    the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, half a millennium later.
</p>
<p>
    6. Peleg's name means "divided by water" and most likely refers to the
    closing days of the Ice Age when glacial melt and the subsequent rising sea
    level covered land bridges between continents.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>280-Year Lifespan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We must start with Job's lifespan found at the end of the book. In his
    extreme pain Job had said regrettable things about God. After he repented
    and prayed for his friends the book concludes by reporting that God doubled
    all he had (Job 42:10). This doubling included ten more children, the same
    number that perished at the time of Satan's attack. Why not 20? Job only
    needed ten more to double the original ten because he would have all 20
    with him forever in heaven. His years followed the same pattern. He lived
    140 years after his ordeal (Job 42:16). His ordeal had not erased from his
    mind the memories of those former years of walking with God and building a
    ranching empire. Doubling his years was like doubling his children-he lived
    140 years after his ordeal to double the 140 years he lived before his
    ordeal, giving him a total lifespan of 280 years.
</p>
<p>
    The above is our conclusion, but how did we get there? Job chapter 42
    begins with the doubling of his animals, not his children or his years.
    Verse 12 says "he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels 1,000 yoke of oxen, and
    1,000 female donkeys." These numbers are exactly twice as many animals as
    he had just before his ordeal, for Job 1:3 states, "He possessed 7,000
    sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys." Then came
    the attack of the enemy. Fire from heaven took the sheep. Chaldeans stole
    the camels and Sabeans plundered the oxen and donkeys. Job never saw them
    again. After his ordeal relatives showed him sympathy and gave him money
    and gold (Job 42:11). With this start he began to rebuild his stock. By the
    end of his life 140 years later Scripture reports that he had exactly twice
    as many animals as before Satan's attack. Indeed, God did double his
    livestock.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Doubling Job's Children</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Next, Scripture speaks of his children. After Job's ordeal, Scripture
    states that "He had also seven sons and three daughters" (Job 42:13). To do
    this God obviously restored his health. Ten is the same number that he
    originally had for Job 1:2 reported "There were born to him seven sons and
    three daughters." Satan killed them all by sending a wind that collapsed
    the house of the oldest brother where they were celebrating. But there is
    an apparent problem. On the one hand "The LORD gave Job twice as much as he
    had before" (Job 42: 10). On the other hand, the LORD gave him only ten
    more children, not twenty. Why only ten more? Wouldn't it take twenty to
    double them? The answer is that there is a fundamental difference between
    Job's animals and his children. Those first animals were lost to Job
    forever. Job would never see them again. But those first seven sons and
    three daughters were not lost forever when the great wind took them.
</p>
<p>
    Job's family believed in the true God, the Creator. When they were killed,
    they went to glory and are there with Job today along with the second set
    of ten. Job has twenty sons and daughters with him forever. God did double
    his children even though doubling them would only take giving him ten more
    whereas doubling his animals would require heaven to stock his land with
    twice the number he had before his ordeal. Heaven's math is flawless.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Doubling Job's Years</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the last verse of Job states that he lived 140 years after his
    ordeal. We understand those years matched the years before his ordeal. But
    280 years places his birth before that of Abraham, Terah, Serug, Reu and
    even Peleg. No known commentator views Job to have lived 280 years.
    Invariably Job is given a shorter lifespan. Why? Where do they go astray?
    Job 42:9 says "The LORD restored the fortunes of Job." Job 42:12 says "the
    LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning," while 42:10
    is more specific: "The LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before." Then
    Scripture gives specific numbers in three categories-his animals, his
    children and his years.
</p>
<p>
    Many students of Scripture conclude the doubling only applied to his
    cattle. They reason that while he received twice as many animals but only
    the same number of children as before, the doubling only applied to
    material possessions. They conclude that only ten more would contradict the
    statement that God doubled all he had so the doubling only applied to his
    animals. Yet others do include his children but not his years. Some even
    include his years but state that he lived 70 years before his ordeal and
    God doubled that number after his ordeal, so that he lived 140 years after
    his ordeal for a total lifespan of 210 years (70+140=210).
</p>
<p>
    It is true that Job involves much mystery, especially about when he lived
    and when the book was written; the ideas and form of poetry are so
    advanced-how could the events have taken place so early? Some find the time
    of the Patriarchs to be a good fit because Jacob's twin brother Esau had a
    son named Eliphaz (Genesis 36:4, 10, 11). They suggest he was the leader of
    the three friends who came to comfort Job. The Eliphaz in the book of Job
    was from Teman and a town by that name existed in Edom, the nation Esau
founded. Others notice that    <a name="__DdeLink__10783_547388351">Issachar</a>'s third son was Yob (Job)
    and suggest that he might have decided to go out on his own after Jacob
    moved his people to Egypt, settling in the Sinai Peninsula where they say
    Job lived. They strengthen this argument by adding that Moses may have
    known him during the forty years Moses lived in the Sinai with Jethro, the
    priest of Midian. They suggest this was how Moses learned Job's story.
    (Jewish tradition holds Moses to be the author of Job.)
</p>
<p>
    But people weren't living to the age of 280 or even 210 in Esau's day.
    Esau's brother Jacob lived 147 years, Levi lived 137 years and Moses lived
    120 years. Further, names are often repeated in Scripture. Most tellingly,
    the city of Teman existed before it was taken over by the Edomites. The
    whole idea of Issachar's son leaving Jacob's extended family in Egypt is
    unlikely. Finally, Job knowing Moses is impossible since the Eliphaz who
    was Esau's son would have lived when Jacob moved his people to Egypt,
    hundreds of years before Moses was born.
</p>
<p>
    Still others disregard the length of Job's life entirely and suggest he
    lived during or shortly before the days of David because the poetry of Job
    is like that of Psalms and Solomon's books. But by that time the average
    lifespan was 70, only half as long as Job lived after his ordeal. In the
    discourses Eliphaz refutes Job's position by asking if Job was so old that
    he possessed all knowledge. "Are you the first man who was born? Or were
    you brought forth before the hills? Have you listened in the council of
    God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself?" Job 15:8-9. Eliphaz next answers
    his question with "Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older
    than your father" 15:10.
</p>
<p>
    Job was not near the end of his life when Satan struck. His father was
    still alive and people even older than his father described as "the
    gray-haired and the aged" were living in his day. Nevertheless, in chapter
    42 God says that Job spoke correctly about Him while his three comforters
    did not which indicates he already had to have lived many years to gain his
    knowledge of God. Therefore, Job had already lived many years at the time
    of his ordeal and others were considerably older.
</p>
<p>
    So, the usual practice is to focus on the animals but not dwell on his
    children or years. What does Scripture do? His animals are mentioned first;
    they were the least important, the most superficial; there is no
    elaboration. His children were far more important so Scripture not only
    reports their number but elaborates significantly on them. Lastly, his
    years were the most important of all. Scripture reports their number and
    elaborates on them with unusual detail as well. This structuring reinforces
    the idea that the doubling applied to his children and his lifespan as well
    as his animals. When they are viewed in this light, only one conclusion
    remains-Job's children set the pattern for the doubling of his years. Job
    lived a total of 280 years.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Four Generations in Job's Second Family</strong>
</p>
<p>
    What Scripture says about those years after his ordeal reinforces our view.
    The sequence begins with "After this Job lived 140 years" (Job 42:16). For
    perspective Abraham lived a total of 175 years so 140 is just 35 years
    short of Abraham's entire lifetime. Jacob lived 147 years or just seven
    years longer than Job's years following his ordeal. Next it says "[He] saw
    his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations" (Job 42:16). The first
    generation would be those seven sons and three daughters. If Job recovered
    his health over the next ten years, he would have begun fathering/begetting
    children ten years into the second 140 years. At the standard rate of
    gaining maturity at the age of 32, the second generations would have begun
    42 years into Job's 2<sup>nd</sup> 140 years. The third generation would
    have begun when he was 74 years into the second 140. Finally, the fourth
    generation would have begun when he was 106 years into the second 140
    years. This is about right mathematically because when he was 140, the
    first of the fifth generation would have just been born.
</p>
<p>
    Wouldn't this also have been true before his ordeal? If so, the first
    generation would be 32-50 years younger than him making him begin when he
    was 32, the second when he was 64, the third when he was 96 and the fourth
    when he was 128. Being 140 years old at the time of his ordeal fits while
    being 70 does not.
</p>
<p>
    Furthermore, the only activity mentioned of his first batch of ten children
    is "eating and drinking," and "feasting." They held feasts in the house of
    each one on his day and their sisters would join them (Job 1:4). The feasts
    lasted for multiple days and Job was not present because the text says
    "When the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and
    consecrate them&#8230;. Thus Job did continually" Job 1:5. This lifestyle
    sounds more geared to retired or semi-retired people. Yet if he was only
    70, the oldest would have been 38 while the youngest would have been 20
    meaning that most of them had not even reached adulthood. But if he were
    140 when they were killed, the oldest would have been 108 and the youngest
    90.
</p>
<p>
    The servant who brought the terrible news called them young people: "their
    oldest brother's house &#8230; fell on the young people and they are dead"
    Job 1:18-19. "Young people" is a relative term, frequently used by an older
    generation for the next generation regardless of age. If they were 90-108
    and Job was 140, "young people" would be appropriate. Further, they were
    not living with their parents any longer. Each owned his own home and ran
    his own life. Thus, his children's easy lifestyle adds further support to
    the idea that Job had lived many more than 70 years and his first ten
    children were far older than 20-38 when Satan struck.
</p>
<p>
    Some will dismiss this line of reasoning as speculative but it logically
    applies the pattern given by Scripture and it is such specific patterns as
    found in all the numbers in the lines of Adam and Shem that make the
    Scripture believable, not mythical.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Support for 280 Years from the Circumstances of His Death</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Finally, Scripture concludes its elaboration on his years by stating the
    circumstances of his death: "And Job died, an old man, and full of days"
    Job 42:17. These words are standard statements in Scripture for living a
    full life rather than a life cut short prematurely or unusually extended.
    His 140 years were not miracle years other than being restored to health so
    he could live the standard lifetime of his day. Abraham's death received
    the same Scriptural notice:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>7</sup>
These are the days of the years of Abraham's life, 175 years.        <sup>8</sup>Abraham breathed his last and died in a good old age, an
        old man and full of years. Genesis 25:7-8.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    An entirely separate line of reasoning involves the hints of many years
    before his ordeal. The book shows he knew much about God. He also was
    careful in his worship of God, always consecrating his sons and daughters
    after each round of their feasting. Job 1:4-5. Of all people God chose him
    to expose the unseen enemy of mankind. All this suggests many years of
    spiritual growth. The size of his ranch suggests he had been at it for a
    long time. His position of highest respect in the nearby town suggests the
    passing of many years. The discourses ask if he were so old he knew all
    things. The very fact that the spiritual leaders of his area came to
    comfort him suggests that he had been around a long time. Job's 280 year
    lifespan is but the first of many reasons to place his birth half a
    millennium before Abraham's. (See Appendix 11.1 for a list of fourteen
    reasons for dating Job early.)
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Job's Character and World</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>1</sup>
        There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was
blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil.<sup>2</sup>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.        <sup>3</sup>He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen,
        and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was
        the greatest of all the people of the east. Job 1:1-3.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This opening paragraph introduces Job as a man without blame. Not that he
    was sinless, but as people looked at his life, they recognized qualities
    like honesty, justice and compassion. Upright comes from straight or
    correct. It answers to righteousness. Job had a high regard for God and
    walked according to His standards.
</p>
<p>
    The words describing Job's character are in the very first verse of this
    sixth longest Old Testament book. But they are repeated and they come from
    the very mouth of God when God says to Satan, "Have you considered my
    servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and
    upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?" Job 1:8. This time
    God adds that Job is at the top of the ladder, in a class all by himself,
    that there was none like him on the earth. Job was the most righteous man
    alive in his day.
</p>
<p>
    That is not all. After Satan had destroyed all of Job's wealth and caused
    all ten of his children to perish, God repeated the phrase: "Have you
    considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a
    blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still
    holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy
    him without reason" Job 2:3. In the face of losing all his possessions and
    ten kids, he retained his integrity. In spite of this crushing blow he was
    still in a class all of his own. None was like him in living the way God
    intended man to live.
</p>
<p>
    The suffering Job endured is so horrible that some feel his account is more
    of an allegory, a story designed to teach God's children to trust Him in
    the worst that could be imagined. No human could possible survive that,
    goes this thinking. Yet he is mentioned as a real person in both the Old
    and New Testaments. James 5:11 speaks of his exemplary patience.
</p>
<p>
    In Ezekiel 14:14 and 20 God emphasizes how certain is the coming judgment
    by saying to Ezekiel, "Even if these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were
    in it [the land God was judging], they would deliver but their own lives by
    their righteousness, declares the Lord God" (14:14). In verse 20 God
    repeats this statement with an oath: "As I live declares the Lord God. They
    would deliver neither son nor daughter. They would deliver but their own
    lives by their righteousness." Both Noah and Daniel are regarded as men who
    really lived. In fact Daniel was alive when God gave this prophecy to
    Ezekiel. This certainly argues that like Noah and Daniel, Job was a real
    person. The experience of Job is more than a moral lesson. It is a record
    of events that actually happened.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Job's Family Business</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The next verses describe his enormous ranch, large family and active
    worship of the true God. Verse three mentions 500 yoke of oxen, 500
    donkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, very many servants and summarizes: "This
    man was the greatest of all the people of the east." The numbers are
    impressive. For instance if his 3000 camels were roped at 25' intervals,
    the caravan would stretch over 14 miles. More seriously, not many today are
    familiar with how such animals could be employed to make Job the wealthiest
    man "in the east." So let us look at the operation and size of such a ranch
    on the basis of general standards of production for these animals.
</p>
<p>
    Essentially Job owned an enormous family business complex consisting of
    three major divisions: farming, manufacturing and trading. Each
    complimented the other and made maximum use of his work force. The work
    year began with spring planting. One ox can pull a plow. A yoke of two
    provide both power and endurance. The man wrestling with the plow would
    wear out long before two oxen. But someone needed to make sure the oxen
    stayed on course, so one man would lead them while the other muscled the
    plow. When the plow man became exhausted, they would trade jobs. Following
    them would be people to break up clods and smooth the dirt. Last of all
    would come the planters.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Division One: Farming</strong>
</p>
<p>
    During planting season most of Job's available community chipped in,
    essentially moving into the field. Each yoke involved a family or two,
    possibly a total of ten people including women and older children. Thus
    5000 people would make the greatest use of Job's 500 yoke of oxen. Being a
    godly man, Job would make sure his workers had a day of rest. Then time was
    needed to set up field camps where the oxen plowed. Most of the area was
    composed of rather narrow valleys or bands of fertile soil broken up by
    numerous rocky hills, plateaus, mountainous regions and wilderness.
</p>
<p>
    Now it becomes obvious why the donkeys were needed. They brought both
    provisions to the field camp(s), sometimes as far as 20 miles from
    headquarters and supplies for planting. The various crops were planted at
    different times. Possibly the planting season extended over ten weeks which
    allowed for about 50 plowing days after subtracting the days for moving,
    rest and bad weather. If each yoke plowed two acres a day, 500 yoke would
    plow 1000 acres a day or 50,000 in 50 days. A square mile contains 640
    acres, so 50,000 acres amounts to 78 square miles.
</p>
<p>
    When the Sabeans stole Job's oxen (Job 1:15), the donkeys were feeding
    beside them. Apparently, Job practiced crop rotation, leaving a portion of
    the fertile land to rest each year. The oxen fed on this resting land at
    night and during the non-plowing season as well. Manure from the animals
    further enriched the fallowing soil for its next cycle of planting. Because
    the area was becoming more arid, possibly one-third of Job's total arable
    land rested each year. Adding this land to the land being plowed brings the
    total land that could be cultivated to 100 plus square miles.
</p>
<p>
    Crops matured for harvest at different times as well, so harvesting also
    lasted for about two months. Again all available personnel were needed for
    the harvest. During the harvest season donkeys carried loads in both
    directions-taking provisions out to the field workers and returning with
    the harvested crops.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Division Two: Manufacturing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wool from Job's 7000 sheep would supply his manufacturing division as well
    as provide meat for his employees and sacrifices for worshiping the LORD.
    Possibly ten garments could be made from the spring shearing of each
    animal. While keeping the sheep involved about 300 men and older boys, more
    help would be needed at shearing time. When the women weren't in the field
    for planting or harvesting, they would be making garments (70,000 a year
    from 7000 sheep). Many would clothe Job's community; the rest would be
    available for trade.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Division Three: Trading</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Job's 3000 camels explain his great wealth. They formed his trading
    division, carrying his farming surplus and manufacturing products
    throughout the region. They would have been resting during planting and
    harvesting while all available hands were involved in those efforts. During
    the trading season each caravan might involve ten to twenty camels, 150-300
    caravans. Each twenty-camel caravan consisted of camel drivers, skilled
    traders and guards, possibly ten men. While camels can walk all day at four
    miles per hour, to save their energy for carrying products, the men with
    them did not ride; they walked except, per chance, for a few elderly,
    highly skilled traders. Those walking limited the caravan to 20-25 miles a
    day.
</p>
<p>
    During the trading season about 2000 of the men of Job's ranch including
    most of the strongest men were involved in caravan operations. Another 300
    cared for the sheep, 200 cared for the donkeys and oxen and still hundreds
    of others provided services for the ranching community and mansions of Job
    and his seven semi-retired sons. Possibly 3000 working age men were a part
    of Job's operation. With retirees, women and children, his entire community
    could have numbered 12,000.
</p>
<p>
    Job's operations stretched over 1000 square miles, given all the unusable
    land within which he found 100 square miles suitable for farming and
    another 50 for the grazing of sheep and camels. The area of his land
    compares favorably with the famous King Ranch of Texas, USA with its 1300
    square miles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Social Life of Job's Adult Children</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each of Job's seven sons had his own house. With Job at 140, his sons would
    be around 100 and have children, grandchildren and even great
    grandchildren. "His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each
    one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat
    and drink with them." (Job 1:4) "His day" is commonly understood to be the
    birthday of each son. "And when the days of the feast had run their course,
    Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning
    and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all." (Job 1:5)
    "Days of the feast" and "run their course" sounds like multiple days for
    each feast and cycles of celebrating. It could be that "his day" was a
    designated day on the calendar like the first day of each new moon or the
    first day of each quarter to kick off another cycle of feasting at each
    brother's house.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Priestly Function of Job</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Following each cycle, regardless of their frequency, Job diligently
    performed the service of family priest, consecrating each son and offering
    a burnt sacrifice for each. The idea that he was very conscientious in this
    expression of faith is reinforced with "Thus Job did continually" (Job
    1:5). So even though his vast business operation undoubtedly kept him very
    busy, he was not too busy to find time to worship God. What previous men of
    faith had learned of God was available in Job's day and on the basis of
    this verbal Bible Job had established a strong trust in God.
</p>
<p>
    The next section will provide numerous further reasons to conclude Job was
    born nearly 300 years before Peleg rather than 400-1200 years after Peleg.
    While it would not seem so, the location of Job's ranch is a significant
    element in determining when Job was born.

<p>
    That very first verse also tells where he lived: "There was a man in the
    land of Uz whose name was Job&#8230;" So, who was Uz and where was his land
    located? Determining all this takes some detective work but many clues are
    available to provide a reasonable answer. One Uz is found among the
    earliest people in the line of Shem. Shem had a son named Aram who fathered
    a son named Uz. This Uz is found in both the genealogies of the Table of
    Nations and those in Chronicles.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. The sons of
        Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash. Genesis 10:22-23.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. And the sons
        of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech. I Chronicles 1:17.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Aram was among those born in the first generation after the Flood; thus his
    son Uz was born in the second. Further, Uz was Aram's firstborn. While
    these are obvious facts they are extremely important and must not be
    overlooked. They mean he was on the ground floor in obtaining land in the
    years after the population scattered following the Tower of Babel judgment.
    His father must have taken his family west because his descendants, the
    Aramaeans, came to occupy portions of modern Syria, Jordan and western
    Arabia. As the firstborn, Uz received choice land-much of what is today
    Jordan and western Saudi Arabia. A substantial population developed across
    this region and a millennium later Job was born. He possessed a large
    amount of land, had incredible business skills, was commendably godly, and
    attracted thousands of folks to his ranching enterprise. He exhibited the
    best qualities of the Shem-Aram-Uz line.

<p>
    <strong>Godliness, Sunrise, Chaldeans, Sabeans and Camels </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Besides the person for whom the land was named, many other clues help
    locate Job's ranch. God says Job was "blameless and upright, one who feared
    God and turned away from evil" (Job 1:1b). Like his ancestor Noah who lived
    a thousand years before, Job was a spiritual beacon in his day. Very
    possibly Noah's Shem-Aram-Uz branch remained true to Noah's God during this
    entire period. Each of the five men who spoke in Job came from different
    people groups yet were descendants of Aram or influenced by Aram's
    descendants. How else to explain their sound knowledge of God?
</p>
<p>
    Another geographical clue is found in Job 1:3: "He was the greatest of all
    the people of the east." The word "east" is "sunrise." Directions were in
    relation to Israel. But since Abraham did not enter Canaan until half a
    millennium later, how can this phrase be explained? The answer lies in the
    work of the Holy Spirit who led the editor/writer to include this in the
    book's final form. This statement locates Job's ranch more to the east of
    Israel rather than to the north as in Syria or to the south as in the
    Sinai.
</p>
<p>
    The assaults of the Sabeans for Job's oxen (Job 1:15) and Chaldeans for
    Job's camels (Job 1:17) point to a west to northwest Arabia location. The
    Sabeans were famous marauding nomads from the depths of the Arabian
    wilderness to the east. As to the Chaldeans the servant was very specific.
    Their style was distinctive; they were well organized; they executed their
    attack military style. Clearly, they were well known in Job's day. In later
    times they occupied a land north of Mesopotamia so they either migrated
    north over the centuries from where they lived in this early period or this
    was a splinter group. This might place Job's ranch more to the northern
    portion of the land of Uz.
</p>
<p>
    Camels are another clue to where and when Job lived. While donkeys were
    used for local transport, camels carried goods long distances. The camel
    does not have a hoof. Instead, it is equipped with a large leathery pad
    that prevents it from sinking into the sand. Their long legs distanced them
    further from the hot earth than the legs of donkeys or horses so they were
    better fitted for hot desert temperatures. They could walk for days between
    watering spots. As will be seen later, Arabia was covered with vegetation
    due to hypercyclones until the waning days of the Ice Age. As the Ice Age
    came to an end and desert regions increased, camels became the standard
    pack animals.
</p>
<p>
    Job spoke of the caravans of Sheba and Tema. The countries of Sheba, home
    to the Queen of Sheba in southwestern Arabia and Tema which was NW of Sheba
    were famous for trading all across Arabia. Job would have been very
    familiar with them and their countless trading routes. His 3000 camels
    would also have been familiar sights across much of Arabia. This places Job
    on the fringe of the Arabian desert where he could still farm successfully
    but also trade in the desert regions to the east.
</p>

    <strong>Other References to"the Land of Uz"</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Very important clues come from the other two times the land of Uz is
    mentioned in the Old Testament. Both references are found in the writings
    of Jeremiah which date two millennia after Job's ordeal. By that time
    nations had formed in parts of the land of Uz so they help to identify the
    entire region of Uz. In Jeremiah 25:15-26 God directs the prophet to make
    the nations drink the cup of His judgment. This judgment consists of defeat
    in warfare. Many nations and kingdoms are in this passage. The list,
    however, contains an order. It begins and ends with the two nations that
    treated Israel the worst-Egypt and Babylon who were the first and last to
    be judged by God. But it also seems to be a listing of nations from closest
    to Israel to those more distant. The following is an attempt to pick out
    the names of the nations without citing the entire content of these twelve
    verses:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>15</sup>
        Thus the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me "Take from my hand this
        cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you
drink it:" <sup>18</sup>Jerusalem and the cities of Judah;        <sup>19</sup>Pharaoh king of Egypt, his servants, his officials, all
        his people, <sup>20</sup>and all the mixed tribes among them; all the
        kings of the land of Uz and all the kings of the land of the
Philistines, <sup>21</sup>Edom, Moab, and the sons of Ammon;        <sup>22</sup>all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and all the
kings of the coastland across the sea; <sup>23</sup>Dedan, Tema, Buz;        <sup>24</sup>all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the mixed
        tribes who dwell in the desert, <sup>25</sup>all the kings of Zimri,
        all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media; <sup>26</sup>all the
        kings of the north, far and near, one after another, and all the
        kingdoms of the world. After them the king of Babylon shall drink.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    God begins with Jerusalem and Judah, the heart of Israel. Then come the
    bordering countries of Uz, Philistia, Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre and Sidon.
    Philistia bordered Israel on her southwest; Edom, Moab and Ammon were those
    small nations that bordered her on her south and east. Tyre and Sidon were
    the small people groups immediately to Israel's northwest. The list
    concludes with countries more distant from Israel-the coastlands, Dedan,
    Tema, Buz, Arabia, the desert, Zimri, Elam and Media.
</p>
<p>
    Remarkably when this list gets into specific geographical regions bordering
    Israel, the very first area is Uz. The next nations were to Israel's
    southwest, south, southeast, east and northwest, leaving only her north and
    northeast for Uz. Damascus representing Syria to her north is absent from
    this list which suggests that Damascus had already been conquered by
    Babylon. The only region left for Uz is the northeast border of Israel.
</p>
<p>
    Lamentations 4:21 confirms the above: "Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of
    Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz." Jacob's twin brother Esau founded a
    nation called Edom and Edom occupied an area SE to SW of the Dead Sea which
    was at least partly in the area of ancient Uz. In a similar way Moab and
    Ammon, the sons of Lot, established nations that occupied portions of
    ancient Uz on Israel's eastern border. The only remaining portion of Uz not
    specifically occupied by a nation in Jeremiah's day was the northeast
    border of Israel. Thus, the land of Uz in Job's day occupied an area from
    northeast to south of the Israel of Jeremiah's day. Job's ranch could have
    been located anywhere within this large territory.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of the book of Job, of all the biblical writers Jeremiah alone
    names ancient Uz as a land. For Jeremiah to think in terms of that area's
    name found in just five words of previous Scripture ["in the land of Uz"]
    suggests the book of Job was a prominent source of his thinking about God.
    It would be a fascinating meditation for someone to dwell on how the book
    of Job contributed to Jeremiah's faith.
</p>

    <strong>Conclusion</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In summary Job lived somewhere in Uz, somewhere east of Israel, somewhere
    that was vulnerable to the Sabeans of the desert and Chaldeans from some
    distant place, somewhere where his caravans could trade throughout Arabia,
    somewhere where he could have traveled to the Jordan River to see Behemoth,
    somewhere where lakes still froze fast, where hail and snow were common,
    and where windstorms might level the strongest houses.
</p>
<p>
    Job lived in the transition from the Ice Age to the post Ice Age period,
    the subject of chapter 11. He lived before Arabia became unfarmable desert.
    Numerous indications point to an area northeast of Israel, somewhere in
    northern Jordan or northwest Arabia, several hundred miles east of the
    Mediterranean. As a descendant of Uz this was the portion of land he
    received and where he made his home in the waning centuries of the Ice Age.
