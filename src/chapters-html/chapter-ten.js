<p align="center">
    <strong>Evidence from the Message of Job for Missing Generations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For a host of reasons some already stated in chapter nine, the Book of Job
    supports the view that Shem's genealogy omits names. This chapter begins
    where God tells Job to recall his watching of the greatest land creature,
    the dinosaur Behemoth, in the Jordan Valley. That certainly happened many
    centuries before Abraham. But Behemoth was just one step in the goal of
    recording the book's essential message for mankind.
</p>
<p>
    We are told in the opening two chapters of Job that Satan caused Job's
    suffering. But far earlier, in the first chapter of the Bible we read
    without elaboration that God created the great sea monster and set him
    apart from all other animals. In Job 41 God finally elaborates on this king
    of pride who struck terror into the heart of man above all other creatures.
    By this we learn that God created him to picture the menace of Satan and
    for this elaborate warning to stand forever in the oldest book of the
    Bible.
</p>
<p>
    As to timing, Job himself was born eight or nine generations before Peleg,
    the fourth named generation of Shem's descendants born after the Flood. Job
    lived in the waning years of the great Ice Age, long gone and forgotten by
    the days of the Patriarchs. In restoring Job who said God hated him, God
    spoke of His creation with more words than in Genesis. Why? Creation showed
    how good and kind God was to Job. With this matter settled God was free to
    reveal the real source of Job's suffering by speaking of Leviathan, the
    divine picture of Satan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Behemoth and Leviathan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    For 44 verses in Job 40 and 41 our Creator speaks of the two enormous
    reptilian creatures mentioned above: Behemoth, a powerfully-built,
    long-tailed land creature and Leviathan, a vicious sea monster of
    tremendous strength that stood at the apex of the animal kingdom.
    Commentaries of the church fathers, those of the Reformation and even most
    today identify Behemoth as a hippopotamus or elephant and Leviathan as a
    sea crocodile or whale. After all, those were the largest land and sea
    creatures somewhat fitting God's description that they knew. Not anymore.
    Today the world's museums are stuffed with the fossilized bones of great
    land and sea creatures that were buried and preserved in the muds of the
    Great Flood. Sea creatures in the Flood's cooler ocean regions and young
    dinosaurs on the Ark enabled both types to survive the Flood and grow in
    population until humans squeezed them out.
</p>
<p>
    But why speak to Job about these two impressive creatures when Job had
    wasted away to skin and bones, enduring the worst imaginable suffering for
    perhaps a year? Wouldn't God comfort Job and explain his pain? In truth He
    did. The creation lecture showed that God was kind and good while those
    monsters pointed to the real cause of Job's suffering. It did not come from
    God but from the evil personage the sea monster depicted-the leader of the
    fallen angels who desires to see every man share his misery in hell
    forever.
</p>
<p>
    Bible commentators with their incorrect interpretations of Behemoth and
    Leviathan have muted Scripture's purpose in exposing Satan's sinister
    character and ignored God's use of the analogy. This chapter presents four
    Hebrew nouns used in the Old Testament to represent this creature and the
    frightening character it was designed to portray. Then it will explore the
    angelic rebellion which required the creation of Leviathan. God's exchange
    with Satan follows. All of this argues for many omitted names in Shem's
    list.

<p align="center">
    <strong>Four Hebrew Nouns for the Sea Monster</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hebrew Noun #1-Tannin</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        So God created [<em>bar'ah</em>] great sea creatures [<em>tannin</em>].
        Genesis 1:21.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    God created the animal kingdom on days five and six of creation week. Of
    all those animals, He named only one-the great sea creature. The Hebrew
    word is <em>tannin</em>. Here the plural form of the noun is used,
    indicating God created many of them just as He caused the waters to swarm
    with fish (Genesis 1:20). The adjective <em>great</em> further
    distinguishes this creature from all others. It forms a Hebrew grammatical
    construction that emphasizes the adjective and can be rendered "the sea
    creatures, the great ones."
</p>
<p>
    To further focus on this creature, God placed him first in a new wave of
    divine creative activity. The Hebrew verb used here is <em>bar'ah</em>
    which specifically means "to create." It is only found three times in the
    creation account. Otherwise, the two more general verbs, "to make" and "to
form" are used to describe God's work of creation. The other two uses of    <em>bar'ah</em> are without question major acts of creation. It is used for
    the creation of the material universe in verse one and for the creation of
    man in verse 27.
</p>
<p>
    Yet, here in verse 21 <em>bar'ah</em> is used for the creation of living
    things that had an immaterial component. Whereas plants created on day
    three have life, creatures created on days five and six of creation week
    have some kind of a mind or immaterial component and this higher level of
    life warranted the primary word for creating. The leading creature in this
    category was the great sea monster. A literal translation would read: "And
    Elohim created the sea creatures, that is, the great ones." The NKJV and
    ESV render tannin "sea creature" here while the NASV uses "sea monster."
</p>
<p>
    Certainly, the creation of creatures that could move was insignificant in
    comparison with the creation of the physical universe and man. Yet, here it
    stands-their creation set apart with the universe and man. Could it be that
    God used <em>bar'ah</em> specifically to raise questions about the only
    named creature in this category? Yet Genesis 1:21 provides no further
    details about him. In this way it seems that God established an open door
    to speak of him at a later time. At the end of creation week God saw all He
    made and it was very good; while enormous, the great sea creature was not
    menacing. The fall of man marred all of God's creation and the sea creature
    became the most fearsome of animals.
</p>
<p>
Hebrew nouns often express characteristics of the thing they name.    <em>Tannin</em> literally means "long-stretched" and in its primary form,
the three consonant verb form means "to stretch."    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup>[1]</sup></sup></a> It
    is found fifteen times in the Old Testament. Five times it is used for a
    snake (serpent). Aaron threw down his staff and it became a <em>tannin</em>
    . Deuteronomy 32:33 and Psalm 91:13 also use <em>tannin</em> in the sense
    of snake. Being a creature that appears to be stretched out because it is
    long and narrow, snakes were miniature versions of the great sea creature.
</p>
<p>
    In the psalmist' day, four hundred years after Moses compiled Genesis,
    Scripture repeats the creation pattern, using the sea creature to represent
    the animal kingdom. Psalm 148 is one of the "Praise the LORD" psalms. The
    first six verses call on angels, sun, moon and stars to praise the Lord.
    Verse seven turns to things on earth; the first thing mentioned is the sea
    creature (<em>tannin</em>). "Praise the LORD from the earth, you great sea
    creatures [<em>tannin</em>, in the plural form] and all deeps" Psalm 148:7.
    This verse would be referring to sea monsters as living marine creatures,
    not analogies to Satan, but it does show they still existed or were at
    least remembered even in the psalmist's day.
</p>
<p>
    The prophets used the sea creature to picture the two great nations that
    oppressed Israel. God addressed Pharaoh as a great dragon in Ezekiel 29:3:
"Behold, I am against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon [    <em>tannin</em>] that lies in the midst of his streams, that says, 'My Nile
    is my own, I made it for myself.'" Three chapters later God tells the
    prophet to "say to Pharaoh King of Egypt: 'You consider yourself a lion of
    the nations, but you are like a dragon [<em>tannin</em>] in the seas'"
    Ezekiel 32:2. The lion was highly admired, considered the most regal of
    animals. Pharaoh represented himself that way. But God said in reality he
    was like the dragon (<em>tannin</em>). While <em>tannin</em> was famous and
    powerful, he was not considered noble. People dreaded the sea monster. He
    had a reputation for being dangerous, sinister and evil, certainly not the
    reputation Pharaoh sought.
</p>
<p>
    Comparison with the sea monster was similarly used for Babylon:
    "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me [Judah]&#8230; he has
    swallowed me like a monster [<em>tannin</em>] [swallows its victim]"
Jeremiah 51:34. Babylon had gobbled up Judah with the same ease that a    <em>tannin</em> gobbled up its victims.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hebrew Noun #2-Leviathan (Job 41:1)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    God chose the ordeal of Job to answer the many questions about the sea
    creature of Genesis 1:21. Job had charged that God was treating him
    unfairly, attacking him like an enemy. He demanded an audience with God so
    he could make his case. After Job's three friends and a young theologian
    falsely accused him of grievous sins, God appeared in a powerful whirlwind
    which established a commanding presence. But He did not bring a crying
    towel, nor did He sympathize with Job or even mention Job's suffering. Most
    importantly, He did not appear to be grilled by Job. Rather, He began: "Who
    is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Dress for action
    like a man; I will question you and you make it known to me" (Job 38:2-3).
    It was Job who needed further enlightenment and not the other way around.
</p>
<p>
    So God would do the questioning and Job would do the answering. God's
    subject was His creation which testified that He was good, that He
    sustained it, that He had filled man's habitat with the fruit of His
    goodness and specifically that He had blessed Job through it. Therefore,
    God was not Job's enemy and had not caused him to suffer. Job was
    speechless.
</p>
<p>
    Two important truths need to be recognized at this point. The questions God
    asked were a universe beyond the learning of Job's day which assures us
    that the Creator of the physical universe Himself was asking them. Answers
    to many of God's scientific questions have only been learned in recent
    years; others still elude today's most advanced science. Mankind did not
    have this knowledge 2550 years before Christ. If these questions had been
    composed by man as unbelievers charge, they would reflect the same bad
    science and even anti-science expressed in the writings of the ancients.
</p>
<p>
    Also, we must recognize how pleased God was (and is) with the
    time-space-matter creation He made. God is more than boasting here, He is
    raving. If we ever wished to hear the Creator discuss His creation of the
    universe, the earth and living things at length, we have such a record
    right here in Job 38-41. These four chapters contain more than the entire
    book of Genesis or any other portion of Scripture on creation. Engineers
    know the difficulty of designing something that works correctly. God speaks
    of many inanimate and living things and they all work with breath-taking
    precision.
</p>
<p>
    So then, if God was not the source of Job's suffering, what explained his
    ordeal? After questions about the physical and animal world, God spent the
    last 44 verses on the greatest land and sea creatures. Ten verses are
    devoted to Behemoth which by the testimony of God was the greatest land
    creature (Job 40:19)-a dinosaur with a long neck, long, powerful tail,
    bones like tubes of bronze and limbs like bars of iron (Job 40:18). All the
    land dinosaurs did not perish in the Flood. One pair of each kind was
    preserved on the Ark to repopulate the world after the Flood. Since many
    reptiles grow all their lives it would have been unnecessary to take full
    grown specimens on the Ark. God would have sent a young Behemoth pair. Over
    a millennium later Job watched these giant monsters in the Jordan Valley.
    While they were gone by the day of Abraham, they were still living in Job's
    day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>King over All the Sons of Pride. Job 41:1-34.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Behemoth was not at the top of the monster ladder. God used him to lead up
    to the most awesome of them all, the great sea creature Leviathan (Job
    41:1). God devotes all 34 verses of Job 41 to this fearsome animal, the
    same number of verses found in the entire six-day creation account of
    Genesis 1:1-2:3. They speak of his exceeding danger to humans but it was up
    to Job to make the connection, that Leviathan represented the source of his
    grief.
</p>
<p>
    A Leviathan was almost impossible to kill. His size, armored exterior and
    ocean habitat gave him an enormous advantage over humans. By comparison man
    had limited maneuverability on or in the water. As to weapons at this time
    man was still limited to his own strength or those powered by his own
    strength such as spears and arrows which were useless against Leviathan.
    Thus, people lived in mortal fear of these creatures. Job knew what God was
    talking about. He had nearly lost his life in some unexplained encounter
    with a Leviathan:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Lay your hands on him; remember the battle-you will not do it again!
        Job 41:8
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    From this we learn that Job traveled extensively because he would have to
    journey to one of the world's oceans or large water bodies to have seen a
    Leviathan unless Lake Lisan was connected to the Red Sea and Leviathan
    occasionally ventured up river to this large inland lake. In verse after
    verse God describes the danger of trying to tangle with him (Job 41:7-10,
    25-29). He terrified people by rising high in the water, then crashing down
    with all his weight (Job 41:25) causing some commentators to conclude he
    was a whale. Many ancient seamen described his aggression, even attacking
    ocean-going vessels. Job said, "Am I a sea monster [<em>tannin</em>] that
    you set a guard over me" (Job 7:12)? Job felt God was watching him with the
    same intensity people set a guard to watch for the sea monster's presence
    once one was spotted in their area.
</p>
<p>
    This second Hebrew word for the sea monster (<em>Leviathan</em>,
    capitalized in English translations) is found six times in Scripture and is
    the one Hebrew word that only refers to this creature or the enemy he
    represented. The Hebrew stem in its various forms connotes a wreath which
    is something round and narrow; in the verb form, "to twist, to surround;"
    together <em>tannin</em> and <em>Leviathan</em> suggest the twisting motion
    of a crawling snake. Psalm 104:26 speaks of this serpent-like creature
    living in the open ocean: "There go the ships and Leviathan, which you
    formed to play in it." Some have concluded that Leviathan was a salt water
    crocodile which is an exceptionally large species of crocodile. However,
    those crocodiles lived in bays and other shallow bodies of salt water. They
    did not play where ships sailed on the high seas; neither would they remain
    in plain sight when humans came along. Rather, they would slip away to hide
    under the water. On the other hand, Leviathan had no fear of humans so he
    did not hide when ships appeared. Most particularly, the sea crocodile was
    not the greatest of all creatures that ever lived as God says Leviathan
    was.
</p>
<p>
    The cursing of the villagers at the arrival of a Leviathan was a fitting
    comparison to the intensity with which Job cursed the day of his birth.
    "Let those curse it [the day of his birth] who curse the day [Leviathan
    arrived in their bay], who are ready to rouse up Leviathan" (Job 3:8).
    Their children would not be safe on the shore or in the water with
    Leviathan around so they had to drive him out of their bay or lagoon or
    move somewhere else until he left. But they cursed that day because in
    rousing up Leviathan, some would be injured, some might die in the battle
    and all would be terrified.
</p>
<p>
    You might wonder if the sea creature (<em>tannin</em>) of Genesis one is
    the same as Leviathan of Job 41. A complete word study makes this obvious
    but Psalm 74:13-14 provides a quick answer by using the two words
    synonymously. It is referring to the Red Sea event: "You [God] divided the
    sea by your might; you broke the heads of the <strong>sea monsters</strong>
[<em>tannin</em>] on the waters. You crushed the heads of    <strong>Leviathan</strong>; you gave him as food for the creatures of the
    wilderness." God parted the sea for Israel to pass, and then returned the
    waters to drown Pharaoh's charioteers. The bodies of soldiers and horses
    washed up on the shore where carrion eating creatures of the desert
    consumed them. There were no actual sea monsters in this event but both the
    words for sea monster and Leviathan are used for the same purpose, as
    analogies to describe just how frightening and lethal Pharaoh's chariot
    army was.
</p>
<p>
    Although ancient writings, including Ugarit (Babylonian) and Canaanite
    literature, give this creature mythical qualities, long before the
    distortions, on day five of creation week God created a real creature that
    was at the top of the animal world, the greatest of all His living earthly
    creatures. God concluded His words about Leviathan with that very picture.
    "On earth there is not his like [equal], a creature without fear. He sees
    everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride" (Job
    41:33-34). Beyond question this creature was a real animal and well known
    to Job and the people of his day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hebrew Nouns #3 and #4-Nachash and Rahab</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Besides <em>tannin</em> (Genesis 1:21) and Leviathan (Job 41:1) two other
    Hebrew nouns (<em>nachash</em> and <em>rahab</em>) are used for this
    creature. <em>Nachash</em> is the primary Hebrew word for snake. It is
    found in Genesis three where Satan used a snake to speak to Eve and trick
    her into eating of the forbidden tree. It appears in Numbers 21 where
    poisonous snakes bit the people and they died. God reversed their lethal
    bites by having Moses fashion a bronze snake and mount it on a pole. By
    looking on the bronze snake whoever was dying from a snake bite would live.
    A derivative of this word is the Hebrew word for copper and bronze. Many
    snakes have the glistening brown color of these metals. Various evil
    connotations arose from the shape and motion of the snake. A verb form of
    this word is used ten times in the Old Testament for practicing divination.
</p>
<p>
    Because of its long, narrow shape and twisting motion, <em>nachash</em> was
    used twice for the sea creature. "If they [the wicked] hide from my sight
at the bottom of the sea, there I will command the [sea] serpent [    <em>nachash</em>], and it shall bite them" (Amos 9:3). Amos had previously
    spoken of digging into Sheol or climbing to heaven to flee from God, so he
    was not talking about the bottom of a shallow bay. He was talking about the
    bottom of the ocean, far below the diving capacity of the sea crocodile.
</p>
<p>
    Job talked about the power of God in chapter twenty-six. God stilled the
sea and by His wind cleared the sky. He pierced the fleeing serpent (    <em>nachash</em>) and shattered Rahab (the fourth Hebrew word for the sea
    monster) (Job 26:12-13). "Rahab" is always used as a proper noun in the Old
    Testament but its various Hebrew forms convey a very specific meaning. The
    masculine noun meant "storm, arrogance." As an adjective it meant "proud,
    defiant." The verb form meant "to act stormily, boisterously, arrogantly."
    Years later the harlot of Jericho who hid the two Hebrew spies received
    this name. Rahab must have been a very assertive person even in her
    mother's womb. The word "Rahab" is also used six times in Scripture for
    what the sea monster represented-those who act defiantly against God and
    His chosen people Israel. Four times it specifically refers to Egypt which
    enslaved God's chosen people. Their ways are likened to those of the sea
    monster.
</p>
<p>
    Besides Job 26:12-13 several other passages use two or more of these words
    together, showing they were synonymous. In Isaiah 51:9 Rahab and the sea
    creature (<em>tannin</em>) are used synonymously: "Was it not you [the
    LORD] who cut Rahab in pieces, who pierced the dragon [<em>tannin</em>]?
    Was it not you who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep, who made
    the depths of the sea a way for the redeemed to pass over?"
</p>
<p>
    Isaiah is speaking of Israel crossing the Red Sea while Pharaoh's pursuing
    army was lost in the sea. In his arrogance and defiance of God's will
    (Rahab-like characteristics), Pharaoh came with the might of a sea serpent
    (<em>tannin</em>), but God easily pierced him and cut his army to pieces.
    While <em>tannin</em>, <em>nachash</em> and Rahab had other uses, they
    together with "Leviathan" are used in the Old Testament about twenty-five
    times to develop an awareness of this intensely evil spiritual being God
    wanted to warn man about.
</p>
<p>
    As revelation progressed God gave man more and more details about the
    dangerous enemy Leviathan represented. Finally, Revelation 12:7-9 and
    20:1-3 clearly refer to him as the great dragon, the ancient serpent, the
    devil and Satan and relate how God removes him in stages. Meanwhile, God
    has provided armor to protect the believer from the cosmic powers Satan
    commands but this armor must be appropriated.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is
        called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world-he was
        thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
        Revelation 12:9.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>10</sup>
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.        <sup>11</sup>Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to
        stand against the schemes of the devil. <sup>12</sup>For we do not
        wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the
        authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness,
        against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Ephesians
        6:10-12.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Thus, God had a very special purpose for fixing this animal in people's
    minds. He designed this creature to represent the leader of the angelic
    rebellion. As the most vicious and dangerous creature known to man, it
    portrayed how harmful Satan is. In common speech it became a measure for
    the worst that man could imagine. Satan is "our ancient foe who seeks to
    work us woe." But while Leviathan was the worst creature a person could
    encounter, he was no match for God. The implication is that when Job didn't
    understand what was happening, he should have trusted God who has the
    greatest power-who is omnipotent. So the first chapter in the Bible singles
    out this creature and the oldest book in the Bible goes into incredible
    detail as God Himself discusses its power and ability to harm.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Creation of Angels and Need for Leviathan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Long before this space-time-matter continuum God created a vast population
    of spirits in His image. Because man was created a little lower than the
    angels (Psalm 8:5; Hebrews 2:7), we can only imagine their fine minds,
    great strength, powerful wills, beautiful worship and bonding friendships.
    Did they all know each other&#8230; a billion or one hundred billion?
    Apparently they had the opportunity and the capacity. But they were not all
    similarly gifted. Some had greater capabilities and higher positions as
    they functioned in their divinely appointed duties. Then one became lifted
    up with pride. Ezekiel 28:12-19, a prophecy with both an immediate and more
    distant application, tells what happened. This evil one set himself against
    God. Even worse he exalted himself and thought in his heart, "I will set my
    throne on high&#8230;I will make myself like the Most High" (Isaiah
    14:13-14). He eventually persuaded a full third of the angelic population
    to support him in his quest to sit on God's throne (Revelation 12:4).
</p>
<p>
    God loved each of the angels He created. With sorrow He exercised judgment.
    To our limited thinking the sentence was unbelievably harsh-incarceration
    in the eternal fire (Matthew 26:41) especially prepared for these fallen
    angels. Yet, while God's sentence on Satan and his followers was pronounced
    in eternity past, it is still to be executed. Instead, God created the
    universe and man.
</p>
<p>
    God marked the leader of these rebels with the name "Satan" which means
    adversary. All would know that there were just two camps-God with His
    forces and the adversary with his; good and evil; light and darkness. To
    this day the adversary and his minions have limited freedom to oppose God's
    work (James 4:7; I Peter 5:8). Somehow the creation of man is a part of
    God's ultimate dealing with Satan. Since Satan can't touch God he seeks to
    harm this instrument of God that somehow is God's tool to execute the
    sentence pronounced long ago-hence, Leviathan. The book of Job brings this
    out more than any other Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    Some maintain that God created the angels as well as man during creation
    week and that Satan fell with a third of heaven's population a short time
    later. Creating angels and man at the same time confuses the immaterial
    with the material. The space-time-matter creation of Genesis one was
    physical and material. Angels like God are immaterial, not physical and
    therefore not a part of God's physical creation. God not only created
    angels before the time that is measured in the physical universe but He and
    His angels shared much activity. Each of the angels had his place. Each
    learned to function in an orderly way. Each learned how to exalt God's
    throne. If a comparison could be made to the human time-frame, it seems
    that far more time went by when God and His angels enjoyed each other than
    has gone on since God created Adam.
</p>
<p>
    Satan's fall after the creation of man introduces the bizarre situation of
    1/3<sup>rd</sup> of heaven's population being consigned to hell just years
    after God created them. No. The heavenly population surrounded God for a
    vast time in eternity past learning their duties and perfecting their
    worship before pride led Satan to gather a vast following to challenge God
    and eventually be put on trial by God and sentenced to the lake of fire.
    The whole idea comes from an over-literal reading of Genesis 1:31 which
    says "God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good."
    Unfortunately, "everything" is understood to be everything God ever made
    rather than the subject of Genesis one which is the creation of all things
    subject to the physical realm.

    <strong>Satan's First Attack on Mankind</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the preceding chapter we saw the consistent life of faith of the one God
    chose to expose Satan's twisted thinking about the Creator and his intense
    hatred for mankind. After just those opening five verses, we entered the
    very presence of God. The veil that separates the physical universe from
    the highest heaven, the spiritual heaven of God's abode, was parted briefly
    that we might learn of a conflict between God and the fallen angels and be
    alerted to the mortal danger in which it places mankind.
</p>
<p>
    When God created Adam, He established one prohibition: "You may surely eat
    of every tree of the garden, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
    evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely
    die" (Genesis 2:16-17). At a later time the Tempter came and persuaded Eve
    to eat from the forbidden tree. He must have swelled with glee and settled
    back to watch the man and woman die. He thought he had thwarted God's plan
    before it even started. But God had far more in mind-a masterful plan to
    overcome man's disobedience and provide hope and respite despite oceans of
    suffering caused by Satan.
</p>
<p>
    As God warned, when man broke the only prohibition He had given him, he did
    die. He died spiritually. This spiritual death was an immediate break in
    the bond between God and man, an alienation, an invisible barrier that
    caused man to hide from God. Further, Adam's disobedience triggered the
    principle of entropy (progressive disorder/breaking down) throughout the
    entire physical creation. It all began to go downhill. Further, man began
    to die physically, a process that took some 900 years in Adam's case. Along
    the way suffering was inherent.
</p>
<p>
    Here now in Job, the oldest book of the Bible, God reveals this conflict
    more fully than in all the rest of Scripture. He demonstrated early how
    sinister, how cruel, how powerful, how hateful that adversary is towards
    his Maker and therefore toward man whom God created to share His heaven. In
    Job God is delivering a message to the world of mankind He loves: "Be
    warned. There is an adversary who works with all his cunning during your
    entire lifetime to ruin you. He is trying to poison your soul just like he
    poisoned his own soul and the souls of those who joined him. Only I and My
    salvation can deliver you from the adversary's doom and destruction in
    eternal fire."
</p>
<p>
    As Job opens, we enter the very presence of God on "a day when the sons of
    God came to present themselves before the LORD and Satan also came among
    them" (Job 1:6). Those who gathered were called "the sons of God." Of all
    humans only Adam and Eve were directly created by God and thus can properly
    be called "the sons of God" in that special sense. However, all the angels
    were directly created by God. Thus, they bear the title, "Sons of God."
    Here God is conducting a mandatory assembly of all His angelic sons, both
    the holy and the fallen.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Questioning of Satan</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In front of the entire angelic population God initiated a conversation with
    Satan. In doing so He would give the angels another lesson in the wisdom of
    His ways. "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him
    on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away
    from evil?" (Job 1:8) What a contrast. Job diligently honored God, living
    in the light of all God had revealed by his day. Satan was the opposite, a
    total rebel. The trap was bated. Satan took it-hook, line and sinker, so to
    speak:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>9</sup>
        Does Job fear God for no reason? <sup>10</sup>Have you not put a hedge
        around him and his house and all that he has on every side? You have
        blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in
        the land. <sup>11</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch all that he
        has and he will curse you to your face. Job 1:9-11.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    God provided salvation for man immediately after the Fall by teaching the
    first parents to offer animal sacrifice, an exercise which unknowingly
    embraced God's lamb to come. Man could not earn salvation; he did not
    deserve salvation; God provided it in grace. Satan slammed God's plan of
    grace, dismissing God's salvation for man as a sham. Evil said light was
    darkness and darkness was light. "Just remove your hedge and then you will
    see his true colors," challenged the Destroyer.
</p>
<p>
    In effect Satan charged that Job feared God because it paid, that God
    bought His worshipers, and that Job didn't truly love God. His worship was
    motivated by self-interest. Job was a hypocrite. Beyond this Satan was
    saying that God's salvation for mankind doesn't work, that His plan to
    provide redemption to those who were born spiritually dead due to Adam's
    disobedience was a hoax. Further, Satan expressed his disdain and sneering
    contempt for God not in private but before the entire population of heaven.
    The hosts of heaven held their collective breathes. How would God reply?
</p>
<p>
    [To pause and wonder: all of this at the beginning of the oldest book of
    the Bible. What a disclosure of high priority in God's mind.]
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>The Attacks of Satan on Job</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>First Attack: Destruction of Job's Possessions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Before that angelic assembly God as much as declared "Let the contest
    begin. We will test your [Satan's] contention. We will see if Job is a
    phony or not. Here were the rules." "All he has is in your hand. Only
    against him do not stretch out your hand" (Job 1:12). With that Satan
    rushed out to orchestrate the senseless destruction of all Job had.
    Messengers arrived one after another from distant parts of the ranch to
    report 500 yoke of oxen, 500 donkeys, 7000 sheep, 3000 camels, the keepers
    and Job's ten children-all gone. What a show of power and hate.
</p>
<p>
    Satan brought the Sabeans of the desert to plunder the oxen and donkeys and
    murder or kidnap Job's servants with them. In a distant region he caused
    some sort of natural disaster, possibly a lightning storm or pyroclastic
    flow from an active volcano, to destroy the sheep and their keepers. From
    beyond the desert he brought the Chaldeans for the camels. He caused a
    freak tornado to come from the wilderness and strike exactly when Job's
    children were celebrating on the day of his firstborn. This mayhem would
    stand for all time as a grave illustration of Satan's power on planet
    earth.
</p>
<p>
    All heaven watched to see what Job would do next. Here is what they saw and
    heard: <sup>20</sup>"Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head
    and fell on the ground and worshiped. <sup>21</sup>And he said, 'Naked I
    came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and
    the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD'" (Job 1:20-21).
    Next, we are given the divine commentary on Job's response. "In all this
    Job did not sin or charge God with wrong" (Job 1:22). The Adversary had
    been wrong. Instead of cursing, Job did just the opposite, he blessed the
    LORD.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Second Attack: Destruction of Job's Health</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Destruction and death had come in Satan's first attack. Job lost not only
    family but longtime, trusted servants. In the following months with heavy
    heart he cared for widows and orphans as he began rebuilding his ranch.
</p>
<p>
    Sometime later the Sons of God were again summoned to assemble before their
    Father. Again the Adversary was singled out. God pointed out that Job
    "holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy
    him without reason" (Job 2:3). God actually said that He destroyed Job
    without reason. Satan did not govern creation. God alone rules. God is
    sovereign. No event happens without His permission.
</p>
<p>
    The Accuser did not admit that he had accused Job falsely. He had taken a
    chance. Maybe Job would crack. But the mental anguish and sense of
    abandonment by God he caused hadn't worked. Satan proposed to change the
    rules of the game.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>4</sup>
"Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.        <sup>5</sup>But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh,
        and he will curse you to your face." <sup>6</sup>And the LORD said to
        Satan, "Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life." Job 2:4-6.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This time Satan would resort to pain, the most intense he could inflict. No
    need to orchestrate Sabeans, Chaldeans, hails of fire and destructive wind.
    Satan made a beeline for Job's ranch in the land of Uz. But he had to be
    careful here. His attack must not be lethal or the contest would
    immediately be over. In fact God had specifically commanded Satan not to
    take Job's life and Satan dared not defy God in the face of a direct
    command. Satan "went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with
    loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head" (Job
    2:7).
</p>
<p>
    Now Job couldn't even work. He was in constant pain. In time he lost weight
    to the point where his bones showed. His skin turned black. The malady
    changed his appearance beyond recognition. It was visible for all to see
    and considered a sign of God's disapproval. People turned against him. Even
    the most despicable showed their contempt by spitting on or at him.
</p>
<p>
    Under the duress of pain people say things they would not otherwise say.
    God knew Job's worship was truly motivated by love for Him, not material
    blessing. But the hosts of heaven, not even the Adversary with all his
    great power, could see Job's heart. This contest was for their sake, not
    God's. As for God, He previously received Job's worship and was exalted by
    it. Now He was exalted by Job's steadfastness while under intense
    suffering. Through months of physical pain Job did not curse God. Then it
    was time to conclude the contest. All heaven watched to see how God would
    end it and restore Job.
</p>
<p>
    Surprises never cease. God, of course, knew exactly what He would do. He
    would use this opportunity to give mankind an answer for undeserved
    suffering, the message for which the Book of Job is most remembered. But to
    get it all out, the angels as well as future generations of mankind would
    have to know what was going on inside Job, what was going through his mind,
    what was in his soul. Thus God moved three of Job's longtime friends,
    possibly noted regional theological authorities like Job to make "an
    appointment to come to show him sympathy and comfort him" (Job 2:11). They
    would end up having an all-day debate with him and in all these words
    everyone would come to know what Job was thinking.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Finding Henry Morris' Book on Job</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now I must become personal. The reason will soon be evident. I certainly
    was fully committed to biblical inerrancy after two years at Multnomah
    School of the Bible (now Multnomah University) in Portland Oregon. After
    completing my undergraduate work at Wheaton College, my four years at
    Dallas Theological Seminary cemented my inerrancy conviction. When I
    abandoned the gap theory through the teaching of Dr. Henry Morris II, 30
    years later, I entered the world of creation science-evidences for a young
    earth.
</p>
<p>
    As my wife and I founded the Mount St. Helens 7Wonders Creation Museum in
    1998, one of the early books we ordered for the new bookstore was Morris'
    book on Job. I was so impressed with it that over the next three years we
    sold about 70 copies which may have made it our top selling book. In my
    hands is my original copy with underlining and highlighting on nearly every
    page. In November of 2000 I wrote that I had begun "a careful study of the
    book." This would have been my second or third reading. In time you might
    say that of all the 66 books in the Bible, Morris' book caused me to
    specialize in the Book of Job. Now sixty-five years of biblical study
    skills have been poured into Job.
</p>
<p>
    Morris showed that the purpose of Job was not undeserved suffering as most
    expositors taught; but as Dr. Harold Wilmington explained in the Foreword,
    Morris felt it demonstrated God's sovereignty to the heavenly population
and reemphasized the importance of God's original creation.    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup></a>
</p>
<p>
    Parents prioritize the training of their children. Some lessons are more
    basic than others and must be taught early on. Such is the Book of Job
    where God graphically presents three foundational truths for understanding
    His heart and making sense of our existence. While each lesson reinforces
    the other two, here is how these lessons become obvious:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson one. </strong>
    God is resolving the discord in heaven caused by the rebellious angels who
    challenged His government. This discord is obvious through God's exchange
    with Satan (Job 1-2) and His analogy to Satan through Leviathan. It leads
    to the second lesson which addresses suffering.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson two. </strong>
    Man is the innocent victim of this angelic warfare. He tries to make sense
    of the suffering it causes, reasoning that God has the power to prevent or
    remove it. But by leaving the fallen angels out of the equation, he ends up
    with the conclusion that somehow God is to blame for suffering. In doing so
    man overlooks the fact that all suffering is produced either directly or
    indirectly by those rebels. The dialogues of Job and his friends picture
    how mankind struggles with this issue.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lesson three</strong>
    . The physical creation is an exquisite and complex game board designed by
    God on which this conflict is played out. That God not only designed but
    also maintains it is sufficient evidence for mankind to trust Him
    completely in what man cannot understand. God provides this lesson in his
    discourse on creation in Job 38-40.
</p>
<p>
    The theological confusion of Job and his friends along with God's
    examination comprises the book's celebrated poetic content, thirty-nine
    chapters which focus on Job's plight (Job 3-41). First, the acrimonious
    discussion of Job and his friends. Then arrogant Elihu who falsely claimed
    God had given him a message for Job. Finally, God came and restored Job.
    This day was also Satan's final chance to so provoke Job that he would
    curse God. Yet when the day was over, Job's confidence in God was fully
    restored.
</p>
<p>
    Job's friends knew much of the ways of God, but there was this great gap in
    their theology-believing that all human suffering was the result of
    personal sin. Purely cause and effect. When one committed sin, God was
    obligated to punish. In this case they were convinced Job had committed
    some awful sin and they continued that vein until God appeared. Eight times
    they stated their position with different arguments and eight times Job
    answered. Job had defended his innocence, but in the process began to
    question God and even condemn God. Then a fourth person angrily pounced on
    Job for his words about his innocence and God's unfairness but basically
    his solution for Job's suffering was no different than that of the others.
</p>
<p>
    Suddenly God appeared, challenged Job to listen carefully and proceeded to
    ask precise questions about major areas of creation. Here He says more
    about His creation than in Genesis or any other book of the Bible. He also
    speaks more personally about it with chapters of profound questions. Some
    still cannot be answered by the world of science. Only the Creator Himself
    could have such intimate knowledge of the universe and its operation. Job
    had thought God didn't care, wasn't paying attention. These questions
    caused Job to realize that God actively and continuously sustains all
    creation so God was not absent or silent but was actively and daily caring
    for Job. Job's heart was thrilled. His Old Friend was back.
</p>
<p>
    Creation is the most basic argument in proclaiming God's love and concern
    for mankind. It sets Him apart from all impostors. When it comes to
    alternatives, how could one not choose the Creator as opposed to the
    adversary in any of his many costumes? Resolving this heavenly conflict,
    recognizing its hurtful effects on humanity and God's provision of the
    physical universe summarizes the message of Job, three subjects of
    earth-shaking proportions all rolled into one comprehensive whole, but so
    novel in part to standard Christian thought that certain details must be
    carefully examined.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Miserable Comforters: A Further Attack by Satan</strong>
</p>
<p>
Job's three friends arrived to find his situation so appalling that    <sup>12</sup>"they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes
    and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. <sup>13</sup>And they sat
    with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word
    to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great" (Job 2:12-13).
    Finally, Job broke the silence as he lamented that the pain was so intense
    that its only escape was never having been born in the first place.
</p>
<p>
    The next chapters (chapters 4-31) contain three cycles of speeches. Rather
    than provide sympathy, the three friends tried to solve the dilemma of
    Job's great loss. Obviously it was more than coincidence. First Eliphaz
    spoke and Job answered. Then Bildad gave his ideas and Job countered.
    Lastly Zophar counseled and Job replied. The first cycle is found in
    chapters 4-14. Eliphaz had an entire week to consider the possibilities and
    then he shared his wisdom. "As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow
    trouble reap the same" (Job 4:8). For two chapters (4-5) Eliphaz developed
    the idea that Job had lived a life of iniquity. Now God was punishing him.
    Here was what Job must do. "As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I
    commit my cause" (Job 5:8). Job gave a lengthy reply in chapters six and
    seven to the effect that such advice was not helpful, even cynical because
    "I have not denied the words of the Holy One" (Job 6:10). Still, he
    implored his friends to provide an answer. "Teach me, and I will be silent;
    make me understand how I have gone astray" (Job 6:24).
</p>
<p>
Bildad weighed in with "Can reeds flourish where there is no water?    <sup>13</sup>Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the
    godless shall perish" (Job 8:11, 13). He affirmed Eliphaz's solution with
    "Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of
    evildoers" (Job 8:20). Job replied at length in chapters nine and ten,
    first agreeing with Bildad, "Truly I know that it is so" (Job 9:2), then
    wondering how anyone could be blameless and finally coming up with the
    opposite answer. <sup>21</sup>"I am blameless; <sup>22</sup>therefore I
    say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked" (Job 9:21, 22).
</p>
<p>
    That really got Zophar's goat. It was his turn and he was livid. He viewed
    Job as stubborn and harangued him unmercifully with statements like "Should
    a man full of talk be judged right" (Job 11:2)? He grouped Job with
    "worthless men" (Job 11:11). His next insult rated five stars. "But a
    stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man"
    (Job 11:12). Donkeys never give birth to people so Zophar views Job's
    thinking as hopelessly stupid. His solution was the same as the others, "If
    iniquity is in your hand, put it far away" (Job 11:14). So far it is hard
    to detect sympathy or comfort.
</p>
<p>
    Zophar rang Job's bell. Following his friends' first three speeches, Job
    began a three-chapter rebuttal with this epic retort, "No doubt you are the
    people and wisdom will die with you" (Job 12:2). Stedman paraphrases Job's
    put down like this: "You've got all the answers, you've solved all the
problems, you know everything."    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup><sup>[3]</sup></sup></a> The
    more they pushed, the more Job pushed back. In the process he said worse
    and worse things about God. He insisted repeatedly that God was treating
    him unjustly. "I want to argue my ways to His face" (Job 13:15). Later he
    asked, "Why do you [God] count me as your enemy" (Job 13:24)? "You put my
    feet in the stocks" (Job 13:27). "You destroy the hope of man" (Job 14:19).
</p>
<p>
    The second round of speeches (chapters 15-21) grew in unkindness and
    hardened positions. The third round (chapters 22-31) included baseless
    charges of specific sins (Job 22:6-9). Eliphaz and Bildad said hateful
    things while Zophar gave up. Meanwhile Job had more and more to say in his
    defense. The two sides couldn't be further apart. Their friendship appeared
    broken beyond repair.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Insights into Job's Responses</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As his friends pushed him to the wall, pressing their assault, Job said
    more alarming things about God, words for which he would later repent. "He
    has torn me in his wrath and hated me" (Job 16:9). "My spirit is broken"
    (Job 17:1). "He has made me a byword of the peoples" (Job 17:6). "God has
    put me in the wrong" (Job 19:6). "He has kindled his wrath against me and
    counts me as his adversary" (Job 19:11). Speaking directly to God, Job
    said, "You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand, you
    persecute me" (Job 30:21). Finally, Job defiantly demanded an affidavit of
    charges from God and stated that he would stand before God as a prince and
    defend himself (Job 31:35-37).
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, his words revealed a remarkable life of faith. "I have
    not denied the words of the Holy One" (Job 6:10). "I who called to God and
    he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughing stock" (Job 12:4).
    "Though he slay me, I will hope in him" (Job 13:15). "For I know that my
    Redeemer lives&#8230;in my flesh I shall see God" (Job 19:25-26). "My foot
    has held fast to his steps, I have kept his way&#8230;I have not departed
    from the commandments of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth
    more than my portion of food" (Job 23:11-12). <sup>2</sup>"Oh, that I were
as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me,    <sup>3</sup>when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked
    through the darkness, <sup>4</sup>as I was in my prime, when the friendship
    of God was upon my tent, <sup>5</sup>when the Almighty was yet with me"
    (Job 29:2-5).
</p>
<p>
    Here, approximately midway between creation and Christ, God's words were
    available, His commandments known, man recognized His light. Further, man
    called on God and God answered him. Therefore, man knew God watched over
    him, had hope in a living redeemer, walked with God, sensed God's
    friendship and lived in the expectancy of ultimately seeing God in his
    flesh. These words testify to a just God who in every age provides
    knowledge of Himself to those who seek that knowledge. Job spoke of himself
    as "just and blameless." He had lived up to all the light God had given.
    God had revealed that He would bless those who so lived. For this reason,
    Job was so confused, so bewildered, so brokenhearted.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Elihu: Satan's Final Attack</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After Job's friends spoke, an angry individual named Elihu demanded a
    hearing. This individual was not a peer of the four. Being young he had no
    choice but to wait until the others had finished. Then he unloaded for six
    chapters (Job 32-37) saying more than the entire books of I-III John. He
    took an entire chapter just to dogmatically state that he had the answer
    (chapter 32). He speaks even more vilely of Job than the three. If Satan
    were using them to destroy Job, how much more this man? Fortunately, Job
    did not reply. Either he was too exhausted or more likely, God broke in
    before Job could say something even more regrettable.
</p>
<p>
    Elihu's demeanor was so disgustingly arrogant one might be tempted to
    associate him with Nimrod, but no one can prove this link for sure. Elihu
    was a Buzite of the family of Ram. Ham's oldest son Cush had a son named
    Raamah (Ram). Raamah fathered Sheba and Dedan. Since these people groups
    are mentioned in the discourses of Job, they could have had a son named Buz
    from whom Elihu came. The most notorious of Cush's sons was evil Nimrod
    (Genesis 10:6-8). While Elihu's actions point to such an association, we
    have previously observed that the same names occur again and again in the
    Old Testament so one must be very cautious about identifying a certain
    individual or place with one previously mentioned.
</p>
<p>
    Deviously Elihu said that Job was wrong about God not speaking (Job
    33:14ff). He claimed that God spoke in dreams but man (Job) didn't listen.
    God also spoke through pain. Further, God sent mediators or angels (Elihu
    is referring to himself) "to declare to man [the sinner] what is right for
    him" (Job 33:23). This angel (the one with an answer from God) says to the
    sinner, "I have found a ransom" (Job 33:24). The ransom is what the sinner
    must do to be restored. In this way Elihu was claiming to have a direct
    message from God which was false.
</p>
<p>
    Then Elihu proceeded to describe how the sinner (Job) should embrace the
    ransom (ie, Elihu's solution) by abandoning his great wickedness which
    Elihu spells out in the next chapters.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>26</sup>
        Then man prays to God, and he [God] accepts him; he [the repentant
        sinner] sees his face [sees God's face] with a shout of joy, and he
        [God] restores to man [to the sinner] his righteousness. <sup>27</sup>
        He [the sinner] sings before men and says: "I sinned and perverted what
        was right, and it was not repaid to me. <sup>28</sup>He [God] has
        redeemed my soul from going down to the pit, and my life shall look
        upon the light." Job 33:26-28.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In chapter 34 Elihu continued at length on how God sees all man's steps,
    particularly Job's, so "there is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers
    may hide themselves" Job 34:21-22. God calls them "worthless," "wicked,"
    and He "shows no partiality," "shatters the mighty without investigation,"
    "overturns them in the night and they are crushed," "strikes them for their
    wickedness&#8230; because they turned aside from following him." "They
    caused the cry of the poor to come to Him" (Job 34:18-19, 23-25, 27-28). He
wishes that Job were "tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men,    <sup>37</sup>for he adds rebellion to his sin" (Job 34:36-37). To Elihu Job
    has acted so wickedly that God should punish him even more severely.
</p>
<p>
    In view of his litany of Job's sins and Job's terrible suffering because of
    them, it is hard to deny that Elihu actually held the same position as the
    first three, that Job's sins had resulted in God's judgment. Yet Scripture
    already told us that Job's loss of possessions and health was not over
    sinfulness but due to an unseen contest in heaven. God said specifically
    before the entire heavenly host "that there is none like him on the earth,
    a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil" (Job
    1:8).
</p>
<p>
    So, contrary to the views of most commentators, Elihu did not have a
    message from God or even the answer to Job's suffering and he was not sent
    to prepare Job for God's visit. While they correctly observe that God did
    not condemn him or require an offering from him or even mention him, we
    suggest he was so blatantly out of order that Scripture leaves the reader
    to correctly assess his discourse. He was clearly Satan's last attempt to
    get Job to curse God. Being young in the faith God let him off with a large
    measure of grace, sparing him further public humiliation.
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand Job's friends were Job's age and knew much sound
    doctrine. Certainly they should have known better than to charge Job with
    specific sins, apparently parroting the idle gossip that spread rumors of
    sins supposedly committed by Job. Elihu would see how God dealt with them.
    Hopefully someday he would match his zeal for God with spiritual wisdom. In
    the end God would say to Eliphaz, "My anger burns against you and against
    your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my
    servant Job has" (Job 42:7). In fact, all four taught God was behind human
    suffering. This was an attack on the very character of God.
</p>
<p>
    Job had stated over and over that he wanted an audience with God. Elihu's
    last words were "He does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit"
    (Job 37:24). The very next words are "Then the LORD answered Job out of the
    whirlwind and said&#8230;" (Job 38:1). Contrary to Elihu's pronouncement,
    God did come to Job, providing further evidence of just how empty Elihu's
    words were.
</p>
<p>
    With the assault of Elihu the contest was over. Job had not cursed God. God
    was vindicated before the angels. Now Job must be restored. As only God
    could, He reestablished Job's fellowship and trust in Him and even reunited
    him with his friends. How God does this is the subject of chapters 38-42.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>God's Creation Discourse</strong>
</p>
<p>
    God accomplishes multiple purposes in his discourse to Job. First, Job had
    said awful things about God and needed to repent. Second, God's anger
    burned against his three friends. They needed to cover their sin with
    sacrifice. Third, Job and his friends needed to be reconciled. Fourth, Job
    needed to learn the true source of his suffering. In fact, all mankind
    needed to know that Satan seeks to destroy us and, in the process, produces
    untold suffering. Possibly theological thinking attributed all suffering to
    God from creation up to Job's day. This idea was a huge distortion of the
    goodness of God and needed to be corrected. In a way, all these individual
    purposes come together to broaden our understanding of God's nature. He is
    perfect love and perfect righteousness. Job is given to help man see more
    of God's glory.
</p>
<p>
    Job felt God did not care about his intense and extended suffering. Job was
    wrong. God did care. If Job's condition had been fatal, upon death he would
    have been welcomed into paradise with superlatives for his notable faith.
    But since God had other plans for Job, He chose to restore his wavering
    faith by appearing to him personally and speaking to him more about His
    creation than to any other person on record in all of human history. This
    was a signal honor. Nevertheless, Job needed to retract statements he had
    made about God under duress, so God's instruction took on a very personal
    form, numerous direct questions about creation that would cause any
    thinking person to realize His careful design of and providential care for
    the earth and its inhabitants.
</p>
<p>
    This was overwhelming evidence that God knew the smallest details about His
    creation and therefore, about Job's life as well as ours. God was working.
    He was involved. How could Job say God didn't care when His creation shows
    He does care. Creation is a huge testimony to God's watching over every
    man. Jesus said God sees a single sparrow that falls to the ground and a
    person is of far greater value than sparrows. In fact, God numbers every
    hair on a person's head (Matt 10:29-31).
</p>
<p>
    Possibly no one has spoken more clearly on the significance of God's
    appearance to Job and its meaning than Henry Morris:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        People say that the Book of Job was written to solve this problem
        [human suffering], so what does God have to say about it? Amazingly,
        God says nothing about it! His divine message, given out of the
        whirlwind, occupies 123 verses in four chapters, yet there is not a
        word about the sufferings of Job, or even about human suffering in
        general. What God does talk about is creation! The mighty message from
        heaven focuses exclusively on the doctrine of special creation of all
        things by God, and then his providential care of his creation. It
        exalts his power, his wisdom, his purpose, his love.
        <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">
            <sup><strong><sup>[4]</sup></strong></sup>
        </a>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    God first addressed Job with, "Who is this that darkens counsel by words
    without knowledge" (Job 38:2)? Job repeated this very statement when he
    repented indicating they were addressed to him, not Elihu as some
    commentators suggest. God then commands Job to "Dress for action like a
    man; I will question you and you make it known to me" (Job 38:3). It had
    been a grueling, exhausting day. How could Job have come to attention and
    focused mentally for another hour? Only with God's help. Surely God
    strengthened His beloved servant to receive His corrective message. God
    would direct the conversation. He would ask the questions. Job was required
    to answer.
</p>
<p>
    First question about creation: "Where were you when I laid the foundation
    of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding" (Job 38:4). For starters,
    God was asking, "How much greater is the Almighty than man?" The missing
    answer is "the Almighty was building a universe when man did not even
    exist." This measure shows just how insignificant man is in comparison with
    the Almighty who set in place the scientific principles that make the
    universe work. Job must have thought, "Oh, Oh! If there are more questions
    like this, I won't be doing much answering."
</p>
<p>
    Later in His four-chapter discourse God reproved him with "Shall a
    faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him
    answer it" (Job 40:2). God was pointing out that Job had spoken sinfully of
    the Creator and he needed to confess his wrong. In the end Job did just
    that.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Effect of God's Questions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    With the thirty-fourth verse discourse about Leviathan God was done. For
    four chapters He had spoken of creating and preserving the universe, the
    earth and all living things on it. He spoke with authority and certainty;
    yet, underneath was an unspoken message of concern and even pleading with
    Job. "How could you say such things of Me when I have done and continue to
    do all this for you?" These words that seem so stern at first really
    contained a deep drawing of Job's heart back to God. Job simply melted; his
    heartache vanished; he replaced silence with words of repentance:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be
        thwarted. <sup>3"</sup>Who is this that hides counsel without
        knowledge?" [Job repeats God's initial question.] Therefore I have
        uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I
        did not know. <sup>4</sup>Hear, and I will speak; "I will question you,
        and you make it known to me." [Job recites God's initial command that
        he now answers.] <sup>5</sup>I had heard of you by the hearing of the
        ear, but now my eye sees you; <sup>6</sup>therefore I despise myself,
        and repent in dust and ashes. Job 42:2-6.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    With this confession of sin Job was again right with God. Now he was needed
    to perform a spiritual service, a priestly function. His friends had
    stirred God to anger by their false representation of Him. They too must be
    brought back to God and Job is asked to be the human agent in this
    restoration. God said to Eliphaz the Temanite:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>7</sup>
        My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have
        not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. <sup>8</sup>Now
        therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and
        offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray
        for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to
        your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant
        Job has. Job 42:7-8.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now it was their turn to repent. Verse nine records that they did. They
    offered the sacrifices God required. No common person could afford to
    sacrifice a bull. The sacrifice of seven bulls and seven rams showed in a
    material way how they had been Job's peers, men of wealth. Job witnessed
    their act of repentance.
</p>
<p>
    But how could Job pray for them after all the ugly words between him and
    his friends. They had said hateful things of him and he had replied with
    increasing rancor: "No doubt you are the people and wisdom will die with
    you" (Job 12:2); "You whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you
    all" (Job 13:4); "Miserable comforters are you all" (Job 16:2); "Ten times
    you cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me?" (Job 19:3);
    "How then will you comfort me with your empty nothings? There is nothing
    left of your answers but falsehood" (Job 21:34); "How you have helped him
    who has no power! How you have counseled him who has no wisdom&#8230;With
    whose help have you uttered words?" (Job 26:1-3). After such sharp words in
    their all-day exchange, how could they ever want to speak to each other?
    How could they ever want Job's prayers and how could Job find it in his
    heart to pray for them? Yet it all happened as God directed:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
        Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD
        accepted Job's prayer. Job 42:9.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    At the age of 140 Job prayed for them, forgiving every unkind thing they
    had said. He illustrates the truth that it is never too late to forgive the
    wrongs others have done to us. Job's confidence in God was restored as he
    saw God in an entirely new light. For his final 140 years he would share
    these radically new insights about the LORD's work in creation and His
    providential care for it. In the end his book would become one of the most
    proclaimed pieces of literature in all human history.
