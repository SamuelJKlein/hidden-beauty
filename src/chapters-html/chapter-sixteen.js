    Chapter Sixteen
</h2>
<h2>
    The Missing World between the Flood and Peleg
</h2>
<p>
    Chapters nine through eleven gave numerous reasons for placing Job's entire
    lifetime before the birth of Peleg-a truth almost universally missed by
    commentators. The Ussher chronology allows only 101 years for all the
    events from the Flood to the birth of Peleg. That period actually covered
    roughly 1300-1900 years by our estimates. The activity during that period
    was both natural and human-natural: reestablishing the earth's equilibrium;
    human: repopulating the earth.
</p>
<p>
    Nowhere does Scripture indicate that God miraculously restored the earth to
    equilibrium once the Ark landed. Rather, Scripture describes events related
    to the Flood that involved processes. After the Flood, mountains grew,
    continents continued to move, oceans cooled and the Great Ice Age came and
    went. Creation scientists are spending lifetimes trying to understand
    mechanisms involved in the Flood and the processes that followed. These
    mechanisms took time to run their course, time which is not available in
    the Ussher scheme.
</p>
<p>
    While Job was born nearly 300 years before Peleg, his country already had a
    considerable history. All this human history won't fit into 101 years. It
    took over two millennia for the earth to reach relative equilibrium after
    the Flood. All this natural history won't fit into Ussher's timeline
    either. This chapter explores the immense amount of activity that can't
    possibly be crammed into the 101 years the 4000-year creation to Christ
    view requires.
</p>
<h3>
    Natural Activity Requiring More Time
</h3>
<p>
    The Flood began when "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and
    the windows of the heavens were opened" (Genesis 7:11). This brief notice
    bundles a plethora of events that God said destroyed the earth (Genesis
    9:11). Just what was destroyed? Not the planet; rather its surface on which
    all life dwells. It took forty days to unleash forces that would ravage the
    earth for another 110 days and resculpt its surface for centuries.
</p>
<h4>
    Hydroplate Theory
</h4>
<p>
    Recently three creation scientists with impressive credentials have
    developed highly attractive theories for what was happening during and/or
    after the Flood. The first is Walter T. Brown who graduated from West
    Point, earned a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from MIT and retired from
    the military in 1980. Since then he has worked on a mechanism he calls the
    Hydroplate Theory. His theory focuses on the phrase, "All the fountains of
    the great deep burst forth." His research explores a world of water that he
    theorizes was trapped in a worldwide series of interconnected, subterranean
    chambers 10 - 20 miles below the earth's surface. All that water, he says,
    was equal to half of the water in today's oceans.
</p>
<p>
    The Flood began, Brown explains, when this water which was under enormous
    pressure broke through the miles of rock above. That initial penetration
    then spread at miles per second until a 45,000-mile-long crack developed in
    the earth's crust, blasting great fountains of liquid and rock 20 miles
    into the sky resulting in massive torrential rainfall. Brown suggests that
    some of the material even broke free of the earth's gravity and formed
    asteroids that orbit the sun today.
</p>
<p>
    Those who study the ocean's bottom have discovered an enormous formation
    they call the mid-ocean ridge. Like the seam of a baseball this mountain
    chain stretches for 45,000 miles. As possibly the most impressive formation
    on the face of the earth (up to two miles high, as much as several hundred
    miles wide and nearly twice the length of the world's circumference), it
    demands explanation. Brown says the bursting forth of the fountains of the
    deep explains it.
</p>
<p>
    In Brown's view when the fountains of the deep shot high into the
    atmosphere, the water cooled and fell over the Polar Regions as ice. Ice
    continued to collect and spread until the upper latitudes were buried in
    what has come to be called the Great Ice Age. He feels that Ussher's date
    of 2348 BC for the Flood does not allow enough time for this and the many
    other processes started by the Flood. He has issued ten editions of his
    book, <em>In the Beginning</em>, through the years and hopes to issue one
    more in his lifetime. Whether he has identified the right mechanism or not,
    Brown has demonstrated his faith in believing what God has said about the
    Flood-that it was global and destroyed the earth. The body of Christ owes
    him its deepest gratitude for his forty some years of research and
    presentations mostly at his own expense.
</p>
<h4>
    Catastrophic Tectonic Plate Theory (CTP)
</h4>
<p>
    John Baumgardner has developed a second mechanism for the Flood called the
    Catastrophic Tectonic Plate Theory (CTP). Like Brown, his credentials are
    very impressive. He earned a M.S. degree in electrical engineering from
    Princeton. Later he completed M.S. and Ph.D. programs at UCLA in geophysics
    and space physics for the specific purpose of trying to find the mechanics
    behind the Flood. He then worked in the theoretical division of Los Alamos
    National Laboratory eventually developing a program called Terra which
    provides 3-D modeling for the earth's mantle.
</p>
<p>
    To cause the Flood Baumgardner theorizes that the entire ocean floor
    plunged to the bottom of the mantle and was replaced by molten rock rising
    from the mantle in regional circular movements. In laboratory studies he
    learned that ocean floor rock which is primarily basaltic continues to grow
    more dense than continental rock which is primarily granitic. He says the
    Flood began when somewhere this rock became so much denser where it joined
    continental rock that it broke free and began plunging below the
    continental rock in a process called subduction. Heat from rock grinding on
    rock was sufficient to degrade the strength of the mantle rock below by
    magnitudes, allowing ocean floor rock to plunge all the way to the bottom
    of the 1800 mile thick mantle.
</p>
<p>
    This initial point of subduction rapidly widened until the entire ocean
    floor adjacent to the great single continent was in the process of
    subduction. As the ocean floor worldwide was dragged to the subduction
    point, it stretched and then tore apart far from land. This tear would grow
    to become 45,000 miles long. Molten rock from the mantle poured up into
    this tear, producing the formation known today as the mid-ocean ridge. This
    mantle rock then flowed from the ridge behind the heavier subducting old
    ocean floor follow-the-leader style to become the new, lighter ocean floor.
    Baumgardner estimates this process ran its course during the first 23 days
    of the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture cryptically describes the cause of the Flood in Genesis 7:11:
    "All the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the
    heavens were opened." While Scripture does not elaborate and no one knows
    exactly what this means, "Fountains&#8230;burst forth" could refer to the
    constant explosions of supercritical water as it was forced from molten
    mantle rock by pressure and heat. The Flood more than doubled surface water
    on planet earth. Before the Flood mountains and oceans were significantly
    less pronounced. As both ocean water and this newly released water from
    molten mantle rock blasted miles into the sky, it cooled and fell as
    torrential rain described in the phrase "the windows of heaven were
    opened." Seeing the coming wickedness of man God would have designed the
    ocean floors with the threshold for failure to come at His appointed time.
</p>
<p>
    Going back a little, the plunging ocean floors also dragged the edge of the
    great continent down, beginning continental flooding. This process also
    displaced ocean water, raising sea level and releasing water contained in
    it. Flow in the mantle caused continental instability and sinking which
    raised sea level even further. Earthquakes constantly shook the earth and
    generated mile-high tsunamis that raced across the land depositing layer
    after layer of sedimentary rock sometimes thousands of miles across, strewn
    with the carcasses of dead animals some of which became fossilized.
    Finally, the continent was flooded. Water stood above the highest
    mountains.
</p>
<p>
    However, by the 150-day mark sea level had dropped sufficiently to ground
    the Ark. Still, the unpredictability of sudden tsunamis that rolled across
    the land produced by endless earthquakes from the movement of continents
    and mantle made it impossible to disembark. It took 370 days from the onset
    of the Flood until these convulsions decreased to the point where with
    proper caution it was safe to leave the safety of the Ark. Then as the
    continents lifted and oceans deepened greatly, the Flood came to an end.
    The Ark had come to rest on land that would continue to rise until the area
    became known as the mountains of Ararat. Today's great mountain chains
    reach up to five miles above sea level. They didn't exist before the Flood
    when the highest mountains were possibly one or two miles high. They rose
    as part of the great upheaval during and following the year-long flood.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Baumgardner says that the Catastrophic Tectonic Plate theory is both
    scientifically sound and verified by field observation. Baumgardner has
    surrounded himself with likeminded creationists who continue to develop his
    theory. Like Brown, Baumgardner continues his research and writing and
    deserves the gratitude of the Body of Christ for his immense dedication to
    God who tells us of a worldwide flood in Noah's day.
</p>
<p>
    As stated, God said the Flood destroyed the earth. He was referring to the
    earth's surface which was drastically altered by processes set in motion by
    the Flood. The most significant process to change the earth's surface was
    the breakup of the great single continent into pieces which moved to their
    present location to form today's continents and large islands. No one knows
    how long this process lasted, but it could have been centuries before the
    continents completed most of their journey. At the same time mountains
    rose, some formed entire mountain chains that reached for the heavens.
</p>
<h4>
    The One Great Ice Age
</h4>
<p>
    For centuries following the Flood, volcanic activity left a thin layer of
    ash high in the atmosphere which reduced the amount of the sun's heat
    reaching the earth's surface. Meanwhile, immense heat from the ocean's
    floors evaporated massive amounts of water which fell as rain at lower
    latitudes and as snow at higher latitudes. This combination of heat and
    cold produced the Great Ice Age. Eventually ocean water would be stored in
    ice sheets up to two miles thick at the continent's upper latitudes,
    lowering sea level by hundreds of feet.
</p>
<p>
    The Flood itself retooled the face of the earth with a new landscape. Then
    mountains rose to give the earth a new topography as vast ice sheets
    reworked formations produced by the Flood and the continental breakup,
    providing concrete evidence that the Great Ice Age followed the Flood.
    Where bands of arid lands exist today, rain fell during that time, at least
    in many places, making that land productive. Even today's Sahara Desert
    enjoyed a measure of moisture for possibly a thousand years after the
    Flood. The Ark survivors found Lower Mesopotamia and Arabia to be something
    of a refuge from the growing cold of the oncoming Ice Age.
</p>
<p>
    The first three generations born after the Flood in the line of
    Shem-Arpachshad, Shelah and Eber-do not show the stress of coping with
    these many hazards-continental movements, rising mountains, accompanying
    earthquakes, lava flows and growing ice sheets-although they immediately
    show the halving of lifespans following the Flood. As explained in chapter
    nine, before the Flood fathers were about 100 years old when they began
    their families and lived an average of 900 years. The first three
    generations born after the Flood fathered their heirs in their early 30's
    and lived about 450 years. Because it took hundreds of years for the Ice
    Age to gather strength and for the mountains of Ararat to rise, it could be
    that the first generations lived half of their lifetimes near the Ark
    before these processes began to take a significant toll on man's strength.
</p>
<h4>
    Missoula Flood Produced by the Great Ice Age
</h4>
<p>
    In the 1920's a newly minted geologist proposed that a monstrous flood
    swept through the Pacific Northwest of the United States. Professor J.
    Harlan Bretz taught at the University of Chicago during the year but headed
    west to conduct field studies each summer. Bretz's "flood" was a hundred
    miles wide, carved up an area covering one sixth of the state of Washington
    and ran its course in just days. That sounded like the Biblical flood. His
    fellow geologists accused him of "heresy," betraying all that his
profession had worked so hard to establish. Since Charles Lyell's    <em>Principles of Geology</em>, published a hundred years before,
    geologists had been busy around the world identifying evidence proving that
    generally, geological formations were produced by slow and gradual
    processes over eons of time.
</p>
<p>
    Bretz's hypothesis had one obvious flaw-no one knew where the water came
    from. Over time geologists began noticing evidences of a lake the size of
    one of America's Great Lakes in the Rocky Mountains of Western Montana.
    Yes, ancient shore lines were identified, etched on the sides of Mount
    Jumbo 900 feet above the modern city of Missoula Montana. As ice sheets up
    to two miles thick melted, water collected for a hundred miles in deep
    valleys. When the ice dam to the west failed, the water rushed to the
    Pacific Ocean over a path 700-800 miles distant, carving what is today
    called the Channeled Scabland. After 40 years of controversy the geologic
    community finally acknowledged that Bretz was right. The formations were
    carved rapidly, not over eons of time. But to this day their explanation is
    still colored with evolution's long ages. One formation has 39 layers. Aha!
    Thirty-nine floods from many ice ages and eons of time! Creationists reply
    that those layers were laid down as water briefly backed up, washing back
    and forth, depositing layer after layer, just as the Flood laid down
    hundreds of layers in a single tsunami over vast areas.
</p>
<h4>
    Massive Vulcanism and the Great Ice Age
</h4>
<p>
    A third creationist Michael Oard spent his working years with the United
    States National Weather Service (NWS), eventually serving for 20 years as a
    lead forecaster in the Pacific Northwest regional office at Great Falls
    Montana. The skills of that office involves understanding the effects of
    weather flowing out of the Gulf of Alaska and from the South Pacific to
    impact the very region where Bretz's flood occurred. The rotating of the
    earth causes these flows to produce cyclical periods of temperature and
    rain fall. Oard came to his NWS position after earning bachelor's and
    master's degrees in Atmospheric Science (1973) at the University of
    Washington and then working there as a research assistant. Loving research
    he used the tools of the meteorologist to understand the Ice Age.
</p>
<p>
    He was amazed that the geological world had developed over 60 models for
    producing an ice age. Why so many? None worked. They were all based on the
    evolutionary time scale of slow and gradual processes. Only a cataclysm
    could bring on an ice age. Further, Oard felt that meteorologists, not
    geologists better understood the movement of weather flows essential to
    producing enormous ice sheets. Upon retirement Oard moved to the eastern
    foothills of the Rockies and conducted field work. Through the years he
    confirmed much of what Bretz and his fellow geologists had found. But it
    looked like one colossal flood produced by just one ice age. In the 1990's
he issued many monographs and in 2004 the semi-technical book    <em>The Missoula Flood Controversy and the Genesis Flood </em>in which he
    wrote the following mechanism for how the Flood would produce an ice age:
</p>
<p>
    The Flood involved unprecedented, wide-spread volcanic and tectonic
    activity. After the continents and mountains rose out of the waters [of
    Noah's flood], a shroud of volcanic dust and aerosols remained, obscuring
    part of the sun. This would cause the land to cool dramatically. The dust
    and aerosols would replenish themselves for hundreds of years following the
Flood due to continued volcanism as the earth moved toward equilibrium.    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><strong>[1]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    The models of secular scientists lacked a critical element-cooling the
    upper latitudes sufficiently to start and sustain the accumulation of ice.
    Somehow heat from the sun had to be reduced significantly. Oard had found
    the necessary mechanism-vast volcanic activity begun by the Flood and
    continuing for hundreds of years providing a thin layer of volcanic dust
    and aerosols high in the atmosphere that would reflect back into space
    enough of the sun's heat to reduce temperatures to the critical point.
</p>
<p>
    Yet it wasn't like daytime was semi-dark for hundreds of years. As
    explained in chapter ten the wave lengths of heat and light are different.
    Due to the length of light waves, light passed through this thin layer but
    the length of heat waves is such that they are significantly reflected back
    into outer space, lowering the percent passing through to warm the earth.
    Light still fell on the earth. Both rainbows by day and stars by night
    could be seen. Lowering summer daytime temperatures was critical for an ice
    age since they would have to be 30-40 degrees colder than normal in places
    like the U.S. mid-west city of Minneapolis Minnesota. In later years the
    ice itself reflected heat rays back into space. Only when the volcanoes
    were silent and the sun's heat could overcome the ice's reflecting work did
    the Ice Age come to an end. The Flood explains the Ice Age!
</p>
<h4>
    Extinction of Woolley Mammoths Due to the Great Ice Age, Not the Flood
</h4>
<p>
    A subset of Oard's studies on the Ice Age is his collection of data on the
    extermination of Woolley Mammoths. Many lived and died beside the Arctic
    Ocean especially in Siberia. Multitudes of their tusks have been mined and
    traded over the last 400 years. Early reports said they were buried in
    sedimentary deposits. That sounded like Noah's flood caused their
    extinction. As Oard collected reports he found most were buried in loess,
    not flood sediments. Loess is the dust produced as ice sheets flow over
    rock and grind it down. Loess pointed to extinction due to the Ice Age. If
    this were the case, the Woolley Mammoths would have died near the height of
    the Ice Age, not in the Flood over half a millennium earlier.
</p>
<p>
    Here is his idea on how they died: As the elephant kind multiplied after
    leaving Noah's ark, some wandered north and eventually found a home along
    the Arctic shoreline. This separated group interbred and developed dominant
    characteristics unique to mammoths. Due to plenty of water, moderate
    climate, a vast stretch of grasslands adjoining the Arctic Ocean and lack
    of predators, their population grew into the millions. But eventually the
    ocean cooled causing the climate to become drier and colder. Lack of fresh
    water and grasses stressed the animals. Intense cold and unbearable weather
    made crossing the ice sheets to the south impossible during the winter
while miles of bogs prevented moving south during the summer.    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    The mammoths were trapped. Blinding dust storms (of loess) buried those
    that died from hunger or exposure and buried others alive. This entire
    species of elephant was just one of many large mammal species that went
    extinct due to the Ice Age. Oard finds the Ice Age useful in another way;
    it provides strong evidence that the Flood was global.
</p>
<p>
    Oard is clear about his view on how many and when ice ages struck our
    planet: "The single Ice Age occurred rapidly within a period of about 700
years following the Flood."    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> He gives substantial
    evidence that the unique conditions for the one Ice Age produced by the
    Flood would have taken much less time than the uniformitarian view which he
    summarizes as follows:
</p>
<p>
    The Pleistocene ice age represents 30 or more successive ice ages (Kennett,
    1982, p. 747). Each ice age supposedly repeats at 100,000-year intervals
    for the past million years and at about 40,000-year intervals before that.
    In these repeating ice ages during the past million years of uniformitarian
    time, 90,000 years represents a glacial period, while 10,000 years are
    times of interglacial moderation. Uniformitarian scientists think we now
live in a rapidly fading interglacial period called the Holocene.    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><strong>[4]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    While that last sentence has nothing to do with our immediate subject-the
    failure of Ussher and others to recognize that Hebrew genealogies are often
    abbreviated-in a way it is our subject. Far more than the earth being 7000
    or 8000 years old, our most basic subject is that God created the heavens
    and the earth to establish man. Therefore, God will sustain the processes
    of nature until the end. Just 30 years ago the scientific world feared the
    onset of another ice age. Today that same universal scientific opinion is
    that man-made warming will destroy the world. Back then geologists found it
    took 90,000 years for an ice age to run its course. If the scientific world
    could not find a satisfactory mechanism for an ice age, how could it know
    that each one lasted 90,000 years?
</p>
<p>
    Seven hundred years is an ice age in record time and can hardly be made
    shorter. It could be Shem's genealogy in the biblical record was the
    leading reason for determining its briefness. The ice sheets did not extend
    into Bible lands but they did affect their climates, producing much more
    ice, snow and rain than today. These altered weather patterns deposited
    moisture in bands a certain distance from the equator that mostly deliver
    dry air today. Scientists identify depressions seen from space in the
    Sahara Desert that were once lakes.
</p>
<h4>
    Time of Job: Waning Years of the Great Ice Age
</h4>
<p>
    Job lived in what became an arid region of NW Arabia (now Jordan) and much
    of the change from moist to dry climate had happened before his ordeal. Job
    was living in the waning years of the Great Ice Age. The process of forming
    those vast sheets of ice, producing large geological features as they
    flowed across the land and finally melting while at the same time causing
    the oceans to fall 400 feet to expose a land bridge between Asia and North
    America and then rising to today's elevation took many centuries. It
    definitely did not fit in the 101 years from the Flood to the birth of
    Peleg. The only place to fit it is the 35-55 omitted generations between
    Eber and Peleg.
</p>
<p>
    The Ussher folks will simply say we are making all of this up. We certainly
    are not making up the fact that the Book of Job speaks more about ice,
    snow, frozen lakes and torrential rains than any other book in the Bible.
    That weather was the experience of Job in his first 140 years and the
    memories of stories told by former generations. Genesis 12-50 covers about
    the same length of time as the first 140 years of Job plus his immediate
    forefathers but instead of ice, snow, frozen lakes and torrential rains, we
    read of drought and famine. Weather patterns cause wet and dry conditions.
    The Ice Age caused a wet pattern in areas that by Abraham's day, long after
    Job and the Ice Age, were dry.
</p>
<p>
    Bible students are for the most part unaware that the impact of the Flood
    lasted for several thousand years. Even though God said "never again shall
    there be a flood to <u>destroy the earth</u>" (Genesis 9:11-emphasis ours),
    few have imagined what the phrase "destroy the earth" involved. As a result
    the standard view has missed the beauty of abbreviating Hebrew genealogies
    that allowed sufficient time for the earth to heal. On the other hand, God
    restated to Noah His original mandate to man to "be fruitful and multiply,
    and replenish the earth" (Genesis 9:1). The earth's surface would heal over
    time but man could immediately begin to fulfill the Creator's plan of
    refilling the earth with His glory where the Ark landed. Later some would
    have to live in caves and others in a world of ice and all would have to be
    very careful as dangers lurked on every hand for hundreds of years.
</p>
<p>
    Oard's field work has focused on the results of the Flood rather than its
    cause. He finds that Vertical Plate Tectonics (VPT) produced vast amounts
    of rock stacked high all around the earth. These include the great mountain
    chains of the world-the Himalayas, the Alps, the Rockies, the Andes. The
    highest mountain is nearly six miles high. Geologists acknowledge these are
    all young by comparison with their estimate of the age of the earth.
    Numerous formations never seen by most people lie on the ocean's floors and
    likewise testify to a recent time of sudden mountain building and deepening
    depressions caused by the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Northrup (chapter 11) preceded these contemporary scientists. He was
    certain that the breaking up of the great continent also left distinct
    geological marks. This idea is not a major feature of the three mechanisms
    above. Maybe in years to come creation geologists will realize that it took
    the better part of several thousand years for the pieces of the great
    continent to move to their relatively recent positions.
</p>
<h4>
    The Canopy Theory
</h4>
<p>
    In closing this section on the time involved in the various theories about
    the causes and results of the Flood, we should mention the Canopy Theory.
    Previous generations of Bible students noted that God separated the waters
    below from the waters above on day two of creation week (Genesis 1:7). They
    concluded that the waters above formed an enormous transparent canopy
    surrounding the earth, producing a greenhouse effect that screened out UV
    radiation, allowed great longevity and even produced a world-wide uniform
    climate. They concluded that the intense rainfall of the Flood was the
    collapsing of this water jacket surrounding the earth.
</p>
<p>
    Today, creation scientists reject this idea. Such a canopy could only
    produce a few feet of rain and would make the world too hot for life. While
    there may have been a thin canopy that screened out some UV radiation and
    allowed great longevity, it would have added mere inches of water needed to
    flood the earth and cover the highest mountains.
</p>
<h3>
    Human Activity Requiring More Time
</h3>
<p>
    Now we will observe indications from Scripture of vast human activity
    between the Flood and the birth of Peleg. Like the activity of nature, all
    that humans did could not possibly have happened if Shem's genealogy were
    complete and Peleg was born just 101 years after the Flood. While Job's
    genealogy is not found in Scripture, his 280 year lifespan places him in
    the gap after the first three names of Shem's list who each lived about 450
    years and before the next three who each lived about 235 years. Eber is the
    third name in the Shem list while Peleg is the fourth and Abraham is the
    tenth. Job lived longer than any of the seven names in the Shem line
    following Eber. The entire Book of Job is a goldmine of historical
    references pointing to much natural and human activity before his time.
    Since we estimate he was born 280 years before Peleg and the Ussher
    chronology only allows 101 years from the Flood to the birth of Peleg, we
    must firmly conclude that the Shem genealogy is abbreviated.
</p>
<h4>
    Founding the Land of Uz
</h4>
<p>
    The very first verse of Job indicates much human activity: "There was a man
    in the land of Uz whose name was Job." Uz, whose land Job lived in, was a
    second-generation descendant of Shem. He preserved the sound theology of
    his father Aram and grandfather Shem. While many rebellious descendants of
    Noah built Babel and its tower, it is unlikely that Noah and his godly
    descendants such as Aram joined those who defied God's command to fill the
    earth after the Flood. More likely, as they saw the growing rebellion of
    Nimrod, they distanced themselves from him.
</p>
<p>
    Uz eventually found his way to the region bearing his name, a sizable area
    to the east and south of Canaan. Various people groups like the Edomites
    gave parts of it their own names nearly two millennia later. Its location
    was still known in Jeremiah's day, 1300 years after Esau. He wrote in
    Lamentations 4:21, "Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, you who dwell
    in the land of Uz." This is like saying "Rejoice and be glad, O Frenchmen,
    you who dwell in Europe." Because Job was a large land owner in the land of
    Uz, he most likely was a well-known descendant in the Shem-Aram-Uz line.
</p>
<p>
    The discourse between Job and the four who tried to help him give us
    detailed information about beliefs, conditions and events in that region of
    the world. After Zophar recited how God blessed the righteous and punished
    the wicked (Job 11:13-20), Job replied, "Who does not know such things as
    these" (Job 12:3)? The blessings and judgments of God were common knowledge
    in the land of Uz. In 6:10 Job said, "I have not denied the words of the
    Holy One." Sound theology was still available in the land of Uz in Job's
    day.
</p>
<p>
    Some will say our explanation about the founding of the land of Uz is
    conjecture. Certainly if there is a fire, something started it. Or more to
    our subject, if Job lived in the land of Uz, someone before him by the name
    of "Uz" must have founded it. Who would say that second generation Uz was
    not godly, did not hold to the ways of the LORD and did not teach them to
    his descendants who carried his name throughout the region so that it
    became known as "the land of Uz?" Job certainly was a distinguished
    descendant of Uz.
</p>
<p>
    As explained in chapter, ten conservatively speaking, Job's vast spread
    contained eight thousand souls. Job was a chief city father of the nearby
    town. The references to it suggest it also had a sizable population. Job's
    friends came from various adjacent regions and Job's several hundred
    trading caravans required sizeable populations to service. It would not be
    unreasonable to estimate that the land of Uz had a million residents.
</p>
<p>
    For a comparable population growth, 520 years after Jacob fathered his
    first son, Israel completed its forty years of wilderness wandering and
    moved into Canaan with a population of 2.5 million. The time from the Flood
    until Uz founded the land of Uz must also be included. This period would
    have begun as the Ark occupants began learning how to cope with the new
    climate produced by seasons and how to grow food in the new soil.
    Eventually most moved away from the mountains of Ararat and settled on the
    Plain of Shinar. Then came the ambition of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel
    rebellion and judgment. At some point Aram would have seen the evil in
    Nimrod's direction and moved his family westward. Eventually Uz founded the
    land of Uz. All this activity took time, possibly 300-400 years. While
    these numbers are only estimates and could well be adjusted in either
    direction, one hundred years between the Flood and Peleg are far too few
    for the populating of the land of Uz. But 35-55 generations between Eber
    and Peleg would be adequate.
</p>
<h4>
    Kings Who Rebuilt Ruins
</h4>
<p>
    Job wished that he had died at birth. Then "I would have been at rest with
    kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves." (Job
    3:13-14). Stories were passed on from generation to generation about these
    kings who once lived and rebuilt ruins. Here a huge amount of human
    activity is implied. First we must go back to Job's birth, nearly 300 years
    before Peleg's birth. If he had died at birth he would have joined those
    who had already died after a lifetime of great achievement. Add another 300
    years. Those ruins the kings rebuilt had once been cities that had sprouted
    up and then failed. Add hundreds of more years. Before those cities began
    growing all the years from the Flood until the dispersal at the Tower of
    Babel had occurred. Add more years. It could not happen in 101 years but a
    thousand years might be sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    Eliphaz inadvertently refers to great antiquity in saying "Listen to me and
    I will explain&#8230; what wise men have declared, hiding nothing received
    from their fathers to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed
    among them" (Job 15:17-19 NIV). Eliphaz was a contemporary of Job. He lived
    in the well-known city of Teman which was southwest of Job's ranch. The
    wise men would have been the teachers in his youth and the fathers would
    have been the original settlers of the land. Job and Eliphaz were 140 years
    old, the teachers would have been one or two hundred years older than
    Eliphaz and the fathers like the founding fathers of the US would have
    lived hundreds of years before that. Then there is the time from the Flood
    until Uz arrived in this land to begin populating it. Again, far more than
    101 years.
</p>
<p>
    Bildad urged Job to "Inquire of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers
    have searched out&#8230;Will they not teach you and tell you and utter
    words out of their understanding" (Job 8:8, 10)? The Land of Uz was settled
    by Uz, a grandson of Shem. This means Uz was born in the second generation
    after the Flood when people lived 450 years. For comparison Eber was born
    in the third. These Land of Uz fathers lived ages before Job. Being the
    fathers of the land of Uz and having lived in bygone ages suggests they
    lived near the beginning of the settling of Uz or possibly a millennium
    before Job was born. They established the sound doctrine in Uz that was
    still available in Job's day. Job died about the time Peleg was born. Add
    Job's 280 years to the millennium before Job when these fathers were born
    and it becomes obvious that Ussher's idea that Peleg was born 101 years
    after the Flood doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
    In rebuffing Job's longest discourse yet Eliphaz asked rhetorically, "Are
    you the first man that was born" (Job 15:7) and "What do you know that we
    do not know" (Job 15:9)? Then he appealed to folks older than Job who would
    testify to knowing what Job had said: "Both the gray-haired and the aged
    are among us, older than your father" (Job 15:10). Not all sons were born
    when their fathers were just 30 or 35. This statement seems to suggest that
    Job's father was much older than Job. Having a son in one's old age was not
    unusual. Abraham had Isaac when he was 100 and Terah had Abraham when he
    was 130. Turning gray was a sign of advanced age while the aged were even
    older. Possibly these references point to people 150 to 200 years older
    than Job. Since Job was born 280 years before Peleg, the oldest of these
    could have been born 400 years before Peleg and the Flood would have
    happened another half of a millennium before that. Here is another instance
    demanding vastly more time than the 101 years between the Flood and Peleg's
    birth.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Peleg and the Time Required to Build Babel</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Associating Peleg with the Tower of Babel judgment is another difficulty in
    Archbishop Ussher's scheme. Peleg's name generally means "divided" (Genesis
    10:25). However, a careful study shows that water is associated with
    whatever is divided in the extensive use of the three consonants that make
    up Peleg's name, PLG. In searching for just how the earth could have been
    divided by water, the melting of the great ice sheets at the end of the Ice
    Age immediately comes to mind. Unfortunately, Ussher missed that fine
    distinction and wrote that Peleg's name referred to the dividing of tongues
    in the Tower of Babel judgment, not water dividing the earth. It is
    supported with the idea that the city and Tower were well along by Peleg's
    birth. This section will show that such an interpretation is physically
    impossible since there would not be enough workers. Just to have enough
    workers would require missing generations between the Flood and Peleg. Yet
    this faulty interpretation says the Genesis 11 genealogy has no omissions.
</p>
<p>
    Further, Scripture implies that this division continued to be more and more
    pronounced during Peleg's lifetime and centered on the earth rather than
    people. It sounds like a process that went on for years rather than an
    event that happened in a moment of time like God's confusing the tongues at
    Babel. Surely the division was about something other than Babel.
</p>
<p>
    Other than the specific meaning of Peleg's name, the issue to examine is
    whether the Babel judgment could have occurred before Peleg was born or
    not. He was born 101 years after the Flood (101 AF) if the MT is a
    chronology. The reason for thinking in terms of his birth is that names are
    normally given to children when they are born, not when they are grown.
    Commentaries generalize that thousands of workers built the Tower. We will
    offer half a dozen reasons to show that no such work force was available in
    the years shortly before Peleg was born. Such issues as the birth clocks
    for reaching adulthood, the effort and distraction of raising large
    families and the unwillingness of the godly to participate in the plan are
    among the factors that required more time than those 101 years until God's
    judgment on Babel.
</p>
<h4>
    Babel and its tower
</h4>
<p>
    The Flood released forces that covered the highest mountains and tore up
    the face of the earth. Five months after it began the waters started
    decreasing and the ark became grounded. The constant pitching and rolling
    of that gigantic floating barge in heavy seas was over. But it was not safe
    to disembark for over seven more months. Consequently, they lived on the
    ark for over a year.
</p>
<p>
    Provisions stored in the ark fed the eight people until they could
    establish flocks, field crops, vineyards and orchards. Over the years they
    raised families, stripped the ark of whatever they could use and explored
    their new world. Active volcanoes nearby caused them to think about finding
    a more suitable land. Eventually they started a migration which ended
    400-500 miles south of the mountains of Ararat where the ark had come to
    rest. The duration of this migration is unknown. The Ararat region
    continued to rise until the tallest mountain, Greater Ararat, reached its
    present height of 17,000 feet.
</p>
<p>
    Noah's extended and growing family settled on a broad plain named Shinar.
    It was as wide as the valleys of Arafat were narrow. When their population
    was sufficient some decided to build a city with a tall tower that would
    reach to the sky "lest we be disbursed over the face of the whole earth"
    (Genesis 11:4). Their statement suggests an awareness of the vast size of
    the earth which would have come from considerable exploration. The tower
    would be a landmark, seen from miles away. Rather than clay bricks dried in
    the sun which were used for ordinary construction, it would be built of
    bricks that were burned to stone in an oven. While such a process would be
    far more labor intensive, the results would be more permanent. Their plan
    showed ingenuity and purpose but dismissed the direct command of God to "be
    fruitful and multiply and fill the earth" (Genesis 9:1). It was rebellion
    to the core.
</p>
<p>
    Did everyone join this rebellion? Noah would not join in a flagrant
    rebellion against the God who had led him to build the ark and save life
    from the Flood. He is named with Job and Daniel as among the most righteous
    men in history (Ezekiel 14:14). What about Shem, Aram and godly Uz?
    Scripture often generalizes. Note the language of Genesis 11:2: "as people
    migrated from the east, they found a plain." This would be like Matthew
    3:5, "Then Jerusalem and all Judea...were going out to him [John...to be
    baptized]." It simply means a large number were going down to John to be
    baptized. Obviously, only a part of the post Flood population joined the
    rebellion. But who was its leader?
</p>
<p>
    The Table of Nations gives much space to a man named Nimrod who was born in
    the second generation after the Flood. His name means "rebellion" so
    possibly this was a nickname given to him in adulthood. Scripture even says
    his empire began with Babel (Genesis 10:10). He was the world's first
    iron-fisted dictator. Certainly the godly avoided this rebellion against
    God and others later escaped his tyranny.
</p>
<p>
    While most commentators link Nimrod to the tower plan, some realize he
    would have been too young to gain the respect and leadership of the world
    by the time Peleg was born 101 years after the Flood, so they suggest the
    city and tower were built in Peleg's lifetime rather than before his birth.
    Later we will cite Keil and Delitzsch who felt it could be done in 150 or
    180 years. Some dismiss Nimrod by pleading the argument from silence-that
    Scripture does not say specifically that he was or became the leader of
    this cause and conclude he was not a leader of the Babel rebellion. Of
    course the argument from silence works both ways. It neither names the
    leaders nor clarifies that Nimrod, to whom it gave much space, was not
    involved in this rebellion. Nevertheless, if Nimrod were the leader, his
    youth would provide another argument supporting our position that the
    building of the tower and city could not have happened so soon after the
    Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Those supporting the 101-year position argue that the city and tower did
    not have to be completed. In fact, they claim, it would be sufficient for
    only the base of the tower to be laid. However, this seems to oppose
    Genesis 11:5, "The LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the
    children of man <strong>had</strong> built" (emphasis ours). The words make
    it sound like it was at least substantially well along. However, the
    project was not finished because when God confused their language,
    Scripture says "they left off building the city." Possibly they built the
    tower first and then proceeded to work on the city.
</p>
<p>
    Artists have rendered beautiful pictures of a monstrous tower and vast
    city. Ancient writings describe Babylon with such a tower. But the ruins of
    Babel have not been located. It is unknown if the ruins of Babylon are the
    same as Babel. While the secular world is well aware of ancient Babylon, it
    dismisses the entire Babel story as myth.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture does seem to indicate that the eight ark passengers and their
    descendants initially stayed together and settled on the plain of Shinar.
    Hatching the idea of constructing a city and tower came after the
    migration. When God did confuse the tongues, it seems many language groups
    were created. This would be consistent with a large labor force
    constructing the city and tower. Next we will see just how many workers
    were available ten years before Peleg's birth.
</p>
<h4>
    The Great Pyramid and the Tower of Babel
</h4>
<p>
    The work force needed for the Tower of Babel can be somewhat guided by the
    well-known data for building Egyptian pyramids. The formula for the volume
    of a pyramid is height times width times depth times 1/3. Khufu's pyramid
    was originally 481 feet high and 756 feet on a side, fixing its volume at
    91.636 million cubic feet. It was the largest structure made by man until
    modern times. Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, it is the only one
    still in existence although erosion has reduced it slightly.
</p>
<p>
    Some Egyptian pyramids were stepped; others had smooth sides. On the other
    hand, Ziggurats, also called temple towers, were massive tiered structures.
    Each higher level was recessed from the one below enabling staging during
    construction. Some 130 pyramids have been found in Egypt while about 120
    ziggurats have been located in Iraq and western Iran. The base of a
    ziggurat is equal to its height while the base of a pyramid is about 1.5
    times its height. A 200 foot high Tower of Babel would have had a volume of
    2,666,667 cubic feet or about 2.91% of Khufu's Great Pyramid.
</p>
<p>
    Most of the effort of pyramid construction is made in the lowest portion of
    the pyramid. For the tower of Babel to reach even 20% of its proposed
    height would have required half the labor needed to complete it. If God
    judged the people when it was only 100 feet high, it would have been 87.51%
    complete and have a volume of 2,333,667 cubic feet which is 2.5467% of a
    100% completed Great Pyramid. That percent of the Great Pyramid's 14,000
    full-time and 26,000 seasonal workers comes to 357 full-time and 662 part
    time workers for ten years.
</p>
<p>
    Comparing the needed work force, however, is a far different matter. In
    comparing the Great Pyramid with Egypt's earlier pyramids, archaeologists
    discovered that the pyramid builders learned with experience. Earlier
    pyramids required far more workers for the same volume of material in the
    pyramid. The Tower of Babel was its builders' first such experience. They
    could have started it several times before an efficient construction method
    was developed, or they could have discovered mistakes that needed
    time-consuming corrections.
</p>
<p>
    Besides the time needed to learn how to build a ziggurat, there was the
    labor-intensive material in the ziggurat. Most of the stones in the Great
    Pyramid were quarried nearby and much of the insides was filled with
    inferior materials; the stones in the Tower of Babel were man made. While
    sun baked clay bricks would require a minimum of labor, the bricks used to
    construct the Tower were burned to stone. This made them extremely durable,
    but it also made them extremely labor intensive. Just delivering the wood
    for the ovens would have required an army of workers. So while the
    equivalent of Egypt's 14,000 full-time and 26,000 seasonal pyramid builders
    would have been 357 full-time and 662 part-time workers at Babel for ten
    years, their inexperience and costly material would have required much more
    labor per cubic foot of material. Possibly these considerations would have
    doubled the necessary work force. Besides this an even larger work force
    would have been needed to build the city. Altogether, several thousand
    workers putting in six days a week for ten years is not an unreasonable
    estimate.
</p>
<p>
    While archaeologists have not yet positively identified the site of Babel,
    the site of ancient Babylon is well known. Its ruins are about 68 miles
    south of Baghdad, Iraq's capital. Historical accounts describe a temple
    tower that once stood in Babylon as having seven tiers, three staircases,
    topped with a temple of exquisite proportions and dedicated to the god
    Marduk. It was called Etemenanki, "The Foundation of Heaven and Earth."
    Hammurabi was said to be the builder of this ziggurat which contained the
    remains of an earlier ziggurat and other structures. Over a thousand years
    later King Nebuchadnezzar built its final stage, making it 297 feet high.
    Today only part of its base remains.
</p>
<p>
    Ziggurats were places where the gods could visit and be close to the
    people, not places of public worship or a burial place for a head of state.
    Nebuchadnezzar built another ziggurat at Borsippa, 7 miles south of
    Babylon. It was 231 feet high. Several tablets and a foundation stone
    explain that he built it on the same design as the Tower of Babel. In
    another text Nebuchadnezzar said, "Nabu's tower (Borsippa) should reach the
    skies and be no less in grandeur than that of Babel." The many ziggurats in
    Iraq and Nebuchadnezzar's inscription and tablets allow the reasonable
    assumption that the Tower of Babel was in the shape of a ziggurat.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the difference between pyramids and ziggurats, comparing Khufu's
    pyramid to Babel's tower can only provide a rough idea of the laborers
    involved in the Tower. But regardless of just how many laborers were needed
    for the Tower and city, the required work force would have been sizeable.
    In fact commentaries repeatedly state that thousands of workers were needed
    to build the city and its tower. But as will shortly be seen, there were
    not enough workers so soon after the Flood. Those who think otherwise make
    unrealistic estimates of population growth.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    Finding Enough Workers to Build Babel (see also Table 15.1)
</h3>
<p>
    The rapid population growth view reasons that if each man had six sons and
    six daughters there would be enough workers to get the city and tower well
    along by the time Peleg was born. However, twelve children per father in
    the generations before the Babel judgment is both unsupported and contrary
    to the experience of family size reported in Scripture. It is reminiscent
    of the numbers generated to produce the several million Israelis in the
    Exodus in just 215-years or four generations. While it could be done if
    every female did nothing but have babies, that is not the way life works.
    However, what was not possible in 215-years would have been possible with
    an additional 215-years. As to growing a work force to build Babel, Keil
    and Delitzsch are more realistic in suggesting that if each mother averaged
    four sons and four daughters, the city and tower could be built in 150 or
    180 years.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
</p>
<h4>
    Changing body clocks for starting families
</h4>
<p>
    In seeking to find enough workers we will start by observing the remarkable
    record of changing body clocks for starting families. The human body did
    not always have the same time clock for birthing children. For instance,
    Adam and Eve apparently had children shortly after God expelled them from
    the Garden of Eden. They could have been just a few years old, but their
    situation is unique because they were created mature adults and were
    capable of having children immediately after God created them. They had two
    sons and at least one daughter whom Cain married.
</p>
<p>
    Then Cain murdered his younger brother Abel and God exiled him from his
    parents. What is surprising is that Adam did not father his next son until
    he was 130 years old if Scripture is complete in its report. The nine
    generations that followed had their named sons when they were 105, 90, 70,
    65, 162, 65, 187 and 182. Apparently after Cain murdered Abel, God reset
    the human clock for having children. The dial now sat at 65-187. Noah, who
    began fathering the sons who accompanied him on the ark at the age of 500
    may have had other sons at an earlier age. Scripture does not say. If he
    did have his first son when he was 500, he was an exceptional case.
</p>
<p>
    We are told there were eight people on the ark-Noah and his wife and their
    three sons and their wives, but no children. Once they were off the ark
    Noah's three sons began having families. Scripture says Shem fathered
    Arpachshad two years after the Flood. Shem was 100. Barring some unknown
    factor, it is reasonable to conclude Noah's sons had pre-Flood body clocks
    for having children. On the other hand Arpachshad, who is the first named
    son born after the Flood, had his first at the age of 35 and the next six
    generations had theirs at the ages of 30, 34, 30, 32, 30 and 29. Now the
    body clock for having children was reset to 29-35. The body clock of those
    born before the Flood for reaching adulthood and starting families stands
    in stark contrast with those born after the Flood-65-187 vs 29-35.
</p>
<p>
    By Jacob's day males were starting families as early as the late teens. For
    example, Judah's two oldest sons married before they were 20 and Judah
    himself fathered Perez and Zerah by his sons' widow, all by the time he was
    45. Obviously, as longevity declined, so did the body clock for starting
    families. By the end of Moses day the average life span was 70, a whopping
    decrease of 375 years from those first three generations born after the
    Flood. This decline in longevity was accompanied by a decline in reaching
    adulthood as is clearly seen in Moses day. In the wilderness Israel
    conscripted every able-bodied male for its citizen-army at the age of 20
    because this was the age of adulthood and marriage by that day. All of this
    illustrates the continuing decline in the body clock for adulthood. Since
    we are talking about the generations immediately after the Flood, we will
    use the age of 30 which was their approximate average age for reaching
    adulthood and marriage.
</p>
<h4>
    Time needed to bear 12 children
</h4>
<p>
    Next, we must account for the time needed to do all the work of bearing and
    raising 12 children. At the rate of one child every two years each mother
    would be nursing one or more children continuously for 24 years and
    struggling with a pregnancy over 1/3 of the time while caring for her ever
    growing family. Once her oldest children could help, they would be pressed
    into the family work force. During their child bearing years the 36 adults
    of the first generation and the 216 adults of the second generation had
    little time for much else than the essentials of survival, but we are
    getting ahead of ourselves.
</p>
<p>
    Arpachshad, the first person born in the new world, arrived two years after
    the Flood, which some commentators take to mean two years after the Flood
    began or one year after it ended. Scripture reports he had fifteen male
    siblings and cousins so counting him and an equal number of daughters, the
    first generation would total 32 children. But since the
    rapid-population-growth people propose six sons per father or a total of 18
    sons and 18 daughters, we will test whether even that many children per
    couple would produce a sufficient work force to build the tower and city in
    time. At the age of 30 Arpachshad would reach adulthood while his youngest
    sibling would reach adulthood 22 years after that. Thus all of this first
    generation would have reached adulthood 54 years after the Flood
    (AF)(2+30+22=54 AF). Shem, Ham and Japheth's 36 children would form 18
    couples to produce the second generation.
</p>
<p>
    When Arpachshad was 35 years old (37 AF) he fathered a son named Shelah who
    represented the second generation. The 18 first generation couples would
    each bear 12 children for a total of 216 people (108 couples) in the second
    generation. The first person, Shelah, would reach adulthood 67 years AF
    (2+35+30=67 AF) while his youngest sibling would reach adulthood 22 years
    later (67+22=89 AF). So 89 years after the Flood all 216 second generation
    children would reach adulthood and be in the process of bearing twelve
    children per couple to produce the third generation. At this point, 89
    years after the Flood, the total adult population of the world would be
    260-the eight Ark survivors plus 36 first generation and 216 second
    generation folks (8+36+216=260).
</p>
<p>
    Yet according to the faulty age of the earth view, in two more years
    thousands of workers would have begun constructing Babel and its tower.
    Really? Not the 216 second generation people. Each of those 108 couples
    would have been super busy bearing and caring for their twelve children so
    it is unlikely they had much time for the construction project. This second
    generation began having children when Shelah fathered Eber in 67 AF.
    Shelah's last sibling reached adulthood 22 years later in 89 AF. For 22
    years (67-89 AF) these 108 couples conceived the 1296 children of the third
    generation which reached adulthood between 97 AF and 119 AF. None reached
    adulthood in time to begin the tower and city in 91 AF so none of them can
    be counted among the thousands of required workers.
</p>
<p>
    Peleg was born in 101 AF, four years after his father Eber reached
    adulthood in 97 AF. Eber gave his son the name "Peleg" (divided) because by
    this time some sort of a division had occurred. Only the sixteen couples of
    the first generation might have been available for the tower project since
    the second generation of 108 couples was busy producing the third
    generation between 67 AF and 97 AF and none of the third generation reached
    adulthood in time to begin building the tower and city in 91 AF. The
    division Peleg's name referred to must be something other than the division
    of languages because the needed work force of several thousand beginning
    ten years before he was born did not exist. Whatever was divided by the
    time Peleg was born was not the language of those who had built a city and
    a tower because there was no city and tower yet. The thousands of workers
    needed to build the city and the tower were yet to reach adulthood or even
    be born.
</p>
<p>
    However, the very idea of each male fathering 12 children is both
    inconsistent with Shem's recorded genealogy and the experience of known
    Scriptural families. Shem, Ham and Japheth fathered sixteen sons, not 18.
    Scripture only reports the number of sons fathered by seven of those
    sixteen. They had a total of 36 sons, not 42, which is also shy of the six
    sons per father proposal. Nothing is said of daughters. It could well be
    that there were not enough daughters for all sixteen first generation sons
    to marry. Besides, one or more of the other nine could have met with
    misfortune. When space is limited literature generally provides the more
    striking than the mundane. In this case the more striking would be the
    largest or most important families. Averages cannot be based on the larger
    families alone.
</p>
<p>
    Then there is the entire issue of the number of reported sons in general.
    In the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) 16 are reported for the first
    generation, 36 for the second, two for the third and three for the fourth.
    Beyond that, Terah had three sons. Abraham was monogamous and had just one
    son by his life-long partner Sarah, although he had seven by two other
    women. Isaac had just two sons. Jacob had 12 sons by four wives or three
    sons per mother. He also had only one named daughter, but he had at least
    one unnamed daughter. To provide wives for his sons who could not marry
    their sisters, other families would have to have more daughters than sons.
    Thus, if for instance, he had a total of four daughters, he would have had
    four children per wife-three sons and one daughter. This is a far cry from
    12 children per mother.
</p>
<p>
    So a more realistic estimate for the first generation is 30 children
    eventually forming 14 couples instead of 36 children forming 18 couples.
    Instead of 216 second generation people, a more realistic number would be
    112 people forming 56 couples. Thus, only the 30 first generation people
    might have been available to build the city and tower because the second
    generation couples were busy raising the third generation and the third
    generation did not start reaching adulthood until 97 AF.
</p>
<p>
    Further, there is the matter of the godly. As they thought about the
    ramifications of not being scattered, they would have dropped out of the
    potential Babel work force. These would have been the ark survivors and
    most of those born in the first generation which leaves only a handful to
    build the city and tower.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, to complete just the bottom 100 feet of a 200' high Tower plus
    a portion of the city, a workforce of several thousand would have to work
    on this project for the ten years before Peleg was born. But thousands of
    workers did not even exist in 91 AF even if each couple had six sons and
    six daughters. More importantly, Peleg's name refers to a division by
    water, not a division by languages. Thus, those who teach that Peleg's name
    refers to the Tower of Babel event are snared in two errors.
</p>
<p>
    All the natural and human activity found in Scripture between the Flood and
    the birth of Peleg took more than 101 years. Therefore, Peleg was born more
    than 101 years after the Flood and this shows that Shem's genealogy was
    abbreviated.
