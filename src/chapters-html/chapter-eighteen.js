<h2>
    Secular Evidence-Those Many Documents Unavailable to Ussher
</h2>
<p>
    Writing is considered the cornerstone of an advanced civilization and
    Sumerian cuneiform, generally regarded as the world's oldest written
    language, developed exactly where Scripture says the descendants of the ark
    survivors migrated-Southern Mesopotamia. In the last century several
    million Ancient Near East (ANE) written records have been discovered by
    archaeologists. None of course were available to Ussher. While these are
    not Scripture, their overwhelming number and consistent testimony provide a
    solid context for Scripture's early post-Flood history and that context
    strongly supports the contention of this book.
</p>
<p>
    This chapter will focus on the most impressive find, the discovery of the
    Ebla tablets while surveying all too briefly some of the many other
    recently discovered and/or deciphered documents and several radical
    alternatives to the biblical timeline. They are not included to prove that
    the Flood occurred before Ussher's 2348 BC Flood date. Scripture does that
    as the preceding chapters show. The discovery of these documents is
    included to show how well-established secular history agrees with what
    Scripture itself reveals and how without them Scripture might seem to
    contain many tall tales.
</p>
<p>
"I remember it well," wrote archaeologist Allan Millard.    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> Millard was referring to
    possibly the most astonishing archaeological discovery ever to confirm the
    biblical findings of this book and shout down 2348 BC. In early October
    1975 the Syrian Director of Antiquities visited Millard's dig site with
    astonishing news: Italian archaeologists digging at Tell Mardikh (Ebla),
    farther north, had found 16,000 cuneiform tablets written between 2400 and
    2250 BC! The tablets provided many important insights into the historical,
    cultural, economic and political life in northern Mesopotamia around the
    middle of the 3rd millennium BC (2600-2250 BC). They included a broad range
    of state-oriented literature-from records of state revenue and diplomatic
    exchanges with foreign rulers to school texts, dictionaries, hymns and
    popular legends.
</p>
<p>
    Today a more precise inventory of the Eblaite palace tablets reports that
    as many as 1,800 complete clay tablets, 4,700 fragments and many thousands
    of minor chips were found. Most were produced in the forty or so years
    before 2250 BC when Ebla was invaded and the palace burned, preserving the
    tablets. While the Ebla documents are outstanding because of their early
    date, they are but the tip of the iceberg. Cuneiform script was invented in
    Southern Mesopotamia's Sumer about 3000 BC and continued to be used until
    near the time of Christ. As other civilizations arose in the region, each
    adopted this script to its own language. An estimated one-half to two
    million cuneiform texts have been discovered just in this area. The British
    Museum alone contains approximately 130,000 texts and fragments. Subject
    matter covers most of the matters of life, all the way from beer recipes to
    law codes to mythology to mathematics. Together they document beyond
    question that civilizations flourished centuries before Ussher's Flood
    date.
</p>
<p>
    Millard wrote that archaeologists in Syria might dream of finding a few
    dozen tablets, or even a couple of hundred. At the famous site of Ugarit, a
    few thousand cuneiform tablets had been dug up over many seasons. Only at
    Mari, far down the Euphrates, had an Ebla-sized hoard been
    discovered-between 20,000 and 30,000; they were found in a palace dating to
    about 1800 B.C. Putting the Ebla discovery in perspective he said that if
    finding a few dozen cuneiform tablets was an archaeologist's dream, finding
    16,000 might well be an archaeologist's nightmare! The studying and
    publishing of a collection of texts of that size would be a gargantuan
    task. "The texts from Mari, discovered since 1933 are still not fully
    published."<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Preservation of the Ebla tablets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Ebla site is located about 35 miles SW of the modern city of Aleppo
    Syria and is called Tell Mardikh after the nearby village of Mardikh. Ebla
    was a major trade center and had long been known to archaeologists from
    ancient writings found in other greater Mesopotamian cities. In 1968 it was
    positively identified when archaeologists at the site recovered a statue
    dedicated to the goddess Ishtar. It bore the name of Ibbit-Lim, mentioning
    him as king of Ebla. More levels were uncovered in the following years. The
    unprecedented palace find was made in the summer of 1975, just 46 years
    ago.
</p>
<p>
    Time is the enemy of ancient written records. Usually, they eventually
    succumb to the elements. But an accident of history preserved the Ebla
    tablets. When invaders burned the palace, the heat baked the tablets,
    preserving them in what the archaeologists call the Central Archive Room, a
    12' by 17' room beside the king's Audience Hall. Immediately south along
    the same wall a passage led to the Administrative Quarter where the king
    usually fulfilled his administrative duties. Alfredo Archi writes that
    similar layouts were found in the royal palaces of Mari and Ugarit. He
    concludes that the Central Archive Room was of major importance to the
successful governing of the kingdom.    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
    A standard archive tablet measured 9x12 inches. These larger tablets were
    arranged on shelves, classified by subject like a modern library and were
    found where they had fallen onto the floor over four millennia earlier.
    Some even had a title on the edge. Smaller rooms contained specific types
    of records. "The most southern two rooms of the Administrative Quarter (L.
    2982, L. 2984) were reachable only from the Throne-room through a sole
    narrow entrance, and were protected by thick walls. They might have been
    the rooms of the treasurer&#8230;where the precious metals were stored. One
    tablet found there, TM.82.G.266, is an account of large numbers of fields,
    cattle, and sheep, and large amounts of silver and gold, whose more
    detailed data could have been obtained from documents of the Central
    Archive."<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Other rooms
    contained daily records which were periodically summarized on the
    standardized tablets placed in the Central Archive.
</p>
<p>
    The tablets themselves found in these eight to ten locations all close to
    the Audience Room, the Throne Room and the Administrative Quarter were
    palace records. They contained not only government and economic documents
    but also literary texts such as myths, epic narratives, hymns, rituals,
    gazetteers and even school-related materials. Since they included
    dictionaries, copybooks and students scratch pads, some have concluded that
Ebla was a major educational center for the training of scribes.    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Development of Writing/Deciphering the Ebla Tablets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Though cuneiform had been deciphered a century before, linguists
    experienced much frustration as they attempted to read the Ebla tablets. An
    explanation of the development of writing and especially cuneiform explains
    why. Sumerians in Southern Mesopotamia began developing cuneiform writing
    late in the fourth millennium BC. Because of the constant interchange of
    Mesopotamian merchants and traders with Egypt, the Egyptians soon began
    developing their own writing system called hieroglyphics. Writing systems
    in other parts of the world developed much later.
</p>
<p>
    The Sumerian tablets were made of dampened clay. The scribe used a stylus
    to make wedge-shaped marks on them. "Cuneiform" actually means
    "wedge-shaped." Because of the complicated combinations of the thousand or
    so signs, only a few people beyond scribes were able to read the tablets.
    The Egyptians wrote their hieroglyphics mostly on a paper-like substance
    called papyrus which eventually turns brittle under very dry conditions and
    moldy under humid conditions.
</p>
<p>
    The two writing systems took different directions. Both began as picture
    writing. Over time cuneiform symbols evolved to words and finally to sounds
    while hieroglyphs remained recognizable pictures throughout its 3500-year
    history. Also, over time the 1000 cuneiform pictures were standardized and
    reduced in number across the region as they came to represent sounds but
    the symbols still numbered in the hundreds. As each major Near East
    civilization near the Mesopotamian population bowl developed, it adapted
    the cuneiform script to express its own language-Sumerian, Akkadian,
    Hittite, Eblaite, Persian, Ugaritic, Elamite, Babylonian and Hurrian. In
    effect cuneiform was the alphabet of the region.
</p>
<p>
    For a modern scholar to read even a single Mesopotamian tablet he first had
    to learn cuneiform with all its different forms through two and a half
    millennia of change which was a herculean task in itself and then the
    specific language he was working with. Eventually the much shorter
    Phoenician alphabet began replacing cuneiform symbols and by 100 BC all
    languages written with cuneiform script had abandoned it.
</p>
<p>
    Two languages appeared on the Ebla tablets: Sumerian, which the linguists
    knew and an unknown language which turned out to be the language spoken in
    the Kingdom of Ebla. But with Ebla's use of cuneiform the problem got even
    worse. While the Sumerian scribes were developing a writing system that
    employed a growing mixture of logograms (a symbol that represents a whole
    word) and phonetic signs, the Eblaite scribes were way ahead. By the time
    Ebla fell about 2250 B.C., its scribes had reduced the number of signs to
    an entirely phonetic system. So the tablets contained a mix of Sumerian,
    older Eblaite and a newer Eblaite using only phonetic signs.
</p>
<p>
    The development of signs representing sounds was a momentous advance in the
    history of writing. This newest form of Eblaite is both the earliest
    example of transcription (rendering sounds in a system invented for another
    language) and a major simplifying step towards "reader friendliness" that
    would enable a wider spread of literacy in palace, temple and merchant
    contexts.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Now it is obvious why the archaeologists had such difficulty accurately
    translating the Ebla tablets. About 80% of the tablets were written using
    the usual Sumerian combination of logograms and phonetic signs in both the
    known language of Sumer and the unknown language of Ebla. But the other 20%
    exhibited the innovative, purely phonetic representation of cuneiform in
    this unknown Semitic language. Further, symbols representing this new
    system must have begun slipping into some of the 80% which used the older
    forms, further tripping up the linguists. Unaware of all this, early
    translation efforts resulted is some of the most sensational claims and
    blatant errors of all times in the history of archaeology.
</p>
<p>
    The name of the Hebrew god and all kinds of biblical place names were found
    in the Ebla tablets-Jerusalem, Gaza, even Sodom and Gomorrah. Over many
    years bilingual Sumerian/Eblaite vocabulary lists were found among the
    tablets, allowing the better translation of Eblaite. Eventually the fine
    nuances of Eblaite were mastered, the mistakes corrected and now more
    accurate information from the tablets is available. Those remarkable claims
    such as finding the name of the Hebrew god and biblical place names were
    translation errors and have been withdrawn.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Subject matter and date of the Ebla documents</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the beginning writing was used primarily for unsophisticated record
    keeping. Transactions, inventories, and government regulations needed to be
    recorded. Early libraries began as warehouses for government and religious
    records. As the library's function expanded, a growing number of scribes
    was needed. Often they were housed in or near the library. Collections
    expanded beyond recordkeeping to include information related to math,
science, agriculture, and theology.    <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="">[7]</a> Ebla was no different.
    Besides business records, royal letters and diplomatic documents, were
    accounts of Ebla's rich history dating back to 3000 BC in the Upper Levant.
    It had trade agreements with numerous other city-states through the
    centuries. Similar records at Mari and Ur spoke of relations with Ebla. At
    one point Ebla controlled the trade route all the way from the
    Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. At other times it controlled trade from
    the Mediterranean to a point partway down the Euphrates and at still other
    times was subject to other kingdoms.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to the final 40 or so years of the Ebla tablets: the process
    of record keeping had become extremely efficient. As previously stated,
    records of daily transactions were kept in specialized areas. Then
    according to various schedules, they would be summarized on a standardized
    tablet which was permanently stored in the Archive Room and the temporary
    tablet was discarded. One tablet might contain all the transactions of a
    certain nature for a year. Some business records contained many columns.
    About 5000 place names were found in the tablets. Some were noted cities in
    Greater Mesopotamia, but most were towns, villages, hamlets or large
    estates that helped identify the parties to the transaction.
</p>
<p>
    The archive tablets were dated in various ways, sometimes by the king's
    name and year of ascension; at other times by his chief minister and year.
    The tablets we speak of bear the names of just five succeeding kings or
    their officials which allowed the archaeologists to date them to the years
    between 2400 and 2250 BC. The names of some of these five kings have been
    found on king lists for Ebla in other cities of Mesopotamia.
</p>
<p>
    Through much of Ebla's history, its chief rival was Mari, the kingdom on
    the Euphrates midway between Ebla and the Gulf. The first Ebla king during
    the archive period was king Igrish-Halam. Payment of tribute to Mari and
    the extensive invasion of Eblate cities by the Mariot king Iblul-ll marked
    his reign as they drained Ebla's resources. Under the next king,
    Irkab-Damu, Ebla's army succeeded in driving Mari back. This was around
    2340 BC. From this point Ebla began to prosper. By the time of the
    destruction Ebla had developed the highly efficient record system explained
    above and was beginning to use the newly invented all-phonetic system as
    well. This growing prosperity and government efficiency are mostly
    reflected in Central Archive tablets dating to 2300 BC or later.
</p>
<p>
    Documents obviously do not reflect events that occurred after they were
    written but may reflect not only the times in which they were written but
    earlier times as well. Ebla's tablets include a massive number of business
    records of the kingdom, giving a powerful picture of its recent economic
    activity. But the tablets were something of a library as well. Alfonso
    Archi's huge 854-page tome covers the detail found in them. He writes
    "While Mesopotamian royal inscriptions limit themselves to simply
    mentioning the principal warlike undertakings of the kings, without
    providing any chronological framework, thanks to the administrative
    documents from Ebla we now know of each of the successive military
    expeditions carried out year after year over a period of forty years
    (2290-2250 BC). These expeditions were all concluded within a year by an
    exchange of messengers, oaths of peace, and other agreements often broken
    after a few years."<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Ebla with its allies had soundly defeated its great rival down the
    Euphrates some 75 years before. Now as 2250 BC approached tablets reveal
    growing desperate measures to stave off the obviously increasing danger
    from Mari. Mari was regaining its battlefield power in the face of Ebla
    forces. Among the Ebla allies royal weddings cemented relations with
    neighboring states. Generous treaties bought friendship with other
    kingdoms. But Mari was doing the same and all of Ebla's efforts were to no
    avail. Sometime around 2250 disaster struck. The capital was invaded and
    conquered. The palace was burned. Who did it? No records have yet been
    found to identify the victor but all assume it was Mari and/or her allies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Testimony to Mesopotamian civilization long before 2348 BC</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now for a look at the larger picture. A fragment here, an inscription
    there, a few artifacts, radiometric dating. They hardly make a case for
    2348 BC being too late. Even the 20,000-30,000 documents and fragments at
    Mari dating around 1800 BC can be explained by those using the Ussher
    chronology approach.
</p>
<p>
    But the dates Ebla establishes are formidable. Archaeologists have
    determined that while Ebla was attacked and destroyed at various times, it
    was generally occupied between 3000 BC and 1500 BC. Yet in just 150 years
    of that 1500-year period (2400 B.C.-2250 B.C.), the cuneiform records
    reveal that an astonishing civilization developed under five kings,
    complete with division of labor, education and highly specialized jobs.
    Women held positions in government and made decisions. By the time of its
    fall an estimated 12,000 civil workers served the palace, nearly 1000 of
    which were involved in record keeping. The capital city and its suburbs
    contained a quarter of a million people. The king was the equivalent of a
    modern CEO of a multinational corporation.
</p>
<p>
    Ebla's non-economic tablets contained a host of additional subjects. Most
    crucial are its records of past rulers, military battles and relations with
    other kingdoms. To some extent they reflect Ebla's history from its
    founding around 3000 BC until 2250 BC. On the other hand, since Mari's
    tablets date to 1800 BC, those tablets reflect the history of that kingdom
    from about 2600 B.C. to it's fall, confirming the overlapping Mari time
    with Ebla.
</p>
<p>
    To restate, most of the Ebla palace tablets were written over just a
    40-year period of Ebla's 1500-year history, from about 2290-2250 BC. Yet
    they only exist because of the rarest of events, baked hard by a fire. How
    many were written during the rest of Ebla's 1500-year history that perished
    through the ages? What about the cuneiform documents written in other
    Mesopotamian cities? Sumer had 18 principal cities in Southern Mesopotamia
    around 2000 BC. Yet most have produced only small quantities of tablets and
    some of those cities have yet to even be identified. On the other hand,
    travelers to Ur in the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries said
    the ground was so strewn with tablets that it was hard to avoid stepping on
    them. Then there are the other dozen or so major cities of the Greater Near
    East. They also were able to write yet in most of them archaeologists have
    found few tablets.
</p>
<p>
    Would it be too much to say that hundreds of millions of tablets were
    written in that area during the nearly three millennia in which cuneiform
    script was used? Greater Mesopotamia contained a dozen major nations or
    city-states and numerous lesser people groups that authenticated each other
    in dozens of ways. The same picture was found across the region. First one
    dominated, then another. They traded with each other. They fought with each
    other. They recorded treaties, histories of the area, lists of kings, names
    of buildings, even solar and lunar eclipses. They told stories about the
    Creator. In a myriad of ways they authenticated each other. How many are
    needed to establish beyond question that civilization was well established
    going back to 3000 BC?
</p>
<p>
    What are the 2348 BC people going to do? Denying Ebla's library is
    impossible. It was enormous. Its words testify to highly organized
    civilizations at a time when the loudest voices in the creation science
    movement say Noah's Flood occurred. People like Josephus, the church
    fathers and Ussher were unaware of the Archive's existence. It had
    disappeared from human knowledge from about 2250 BC until 1975 AD. Now it
    has been found and fascinates us with its history. By comparison most of
    the 900 Dead Sea Scrolls consist of collections of verses or part of a
    chapter of the Bible. Only one, the Isaiah Scroll, contains a complete book
    of the Bible-the full text of all 66 chapters of that book.
</p>
<p>
    Some will claim this is all made up, that these are just the words of those
    with academic credentials and that the Word of God is greater than any
    academic credential. Such a claim is a half-truth. For certain the Word of
    God is greater than any academic credential. But the Word of God itself
    testifies to much time passing after the Flood before Abraham was born in
    Sumerian Ur. As to the genealogy of Shem, it is better understood as a
    record of 45-65 generations than ten. This places the Flood 1300-1900 years
    earlier than those who defend the Ussher date. Nevertheless, recognizing a
    major new idea in Scripture can take years or even lifetimes. Some will not
    accept this truth until they get to heaven.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Putting the Discovery of Written Records in Perspective</strong>
</p>
<p>
    One of the early criticisms of the Bible was that Moses (1526 B.C-1406
    B.C.) could not have written the Pentateuch since writing was not yet
    invented. Now we learn that people wrote 1500 years before Moses. But those
    thousand or so cuneiform symbols limited reading and writing to a select
    few. Even at the time when most of the Ebla tablets were written between
    2290 and 2250 BC, people in the Kingdom of Ebla still had to learn some 600
    symbols to read and write. One hundred years later Abraham grew up in Ur
    where boys learned to read and write and even do modern high school math,
    all using the cuneiform system of writing. Amazingly cuneiform continued to
    be used until just several hundred years before Christ. In contrast the
    Phoenician Alphabet which appeared around 1000 BC contained 22 consonants
    and no vowels. It was spread by Phoenician merchants and adopted with
    modifications by Greeks and Hebrews, among many other peoples in that
    region.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast with these written records are other evidences that speak of
    extensive human activity in the region where the Flood survivors began to
    rebuild the world's population. Some, like radio isotope dating, are
    misdirected, building on the premise that the world is billions of years
    old, so its conclusions will support its premise and that is a logical
    fallacy called circular reasoning. Even such approaches as pottery dating
    and the use of materials for tools such as stone, bronze and iron can be
    misleading. But written documents have the greatest credibility and to some
    extent can be weighed objectively.
</p>
<p>
    Where did the Church Fathers and Bishop Ussher go wrong? They failed to
    recognize the hidden beauty of Hebrew genealogies and instead treated them
    as secular societies used them. They overlooked the gradual decline of
    longevity after the Flood and the 1300-1900 years of history that passed
    between Eber and Peleg.
</p>
<p>
    The Ebla tablets plus tens of thousands found at other locations reveal
    exactly what the Bible records of life recovering after the world-wide
    Flood. As descendants of the eight Ark survivors migrated from the
    mountains of Ararat to the plains of Southern Mesopotamia over the next 200
    years, they defied God's instructions to repopulate the entire earth and
    founded the first advanced civilization at Babel. While they did not
    develop a written language, they did build a city and a tower reaching to
    heaven. God saw what they were doing and stated "Nothing that they propose
    to do will now be impossible for them" (Genesis 11:6). In judgment God
    confused their language which caused this advanced civilization to
    reproduce itself in dozens of locations across Greater Mesopotamia and
    Arabia.
</p>
<p>
    Explorers took this advanced civilization to other favorable locations to
    establish similar civilizations in the river valleys of Egypt, India and
    China. Those who encountered the Ice Age in the upper latitudes adopted
    primitive Stone Age hunting-gathering lifestyles to survive. This is the
    picture Scripture paints and it is confirmed by the findings of
    archaeology. Archaeologists puzzle over why civilization developed that
    specific way in the very recent historic past. The Bible has the answer-the
    eight ark survivors reestablished mankind after the Great Flood in a world
    of new land forms and climate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Claims of Alternate ANE chronologies </strong>
</p>
<p>
    David Rohl maintains that the chronology of pharaohs is wrong, that the
    Middle Kingdom dates are 300 years too early. He says dynasties in Upper
    Egypt and Lower Egypt coexisted but scholars have treated their years
    linearly so when the duplications are removed Egypt's chronology agrees
    with his dating of the Exodus. A leading creation scientist cites Rohl's
    work to justify accepting Shem's genealogy as complete so just who is David
    Rohl and what do real scholars think of his work?
</p>
<p>
    Rohl says he became enamored with Egypt at the age of 11 when his family
    was treated to a Nile River boat ride on King Farouk's stern wheeler. In
    adulthood he formed a rock band and recorded several albums. He worked as a
    sound technician but on the side he read about ancient Egyptian and Near
    East history. He had a fertile imagination and began writing fiction with
    the Near East as background. In his forties he earned a bachelor degree in
    Egyptian studies and continues to promote his ideas about Egyptian
    chronology.
</p>
<p>
    What does the scholarly world think of his chronology? No Egyptologist has
    endorsed his idea. Kenneth Kitchen, renowned Egyptologist has a single word
    for 300 too many years in the Egyptian chronology, "nonsense." As to Rohl's
    beliefs, he is an agnostic. He believes the Bible is a record of ancient
    history just like many other histories but he does not believe it is the
    inspired Word of God. Why would any creationist place greater faith in this
    man than in true inerrancy biblical scholars? There can be but one
    answer-this man confirms their misinterpretation of Hebrew genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    Truth be told, secular scholars have produced a range of
    chronologies-short, shorter, long, longer, median, etc. Their median
    chronology seems to work pretty well with the biblical chronology once
    Hebrew genealogical practice is factored in. The shortened chronologies of
    Rohl and others actually conflict with the Scriptural timeline.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Claim that the Bible Borrowed from Cuneiform Tablets</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An entire pole (or world) away is a line of secular thinking summarized by
    free-lance writer Joshua Mark that myths found in ancient cuneiform tablets
    were borrowed and embellished by Jewish scribes and became stories in the
Bible. The following quotes are taken from an article by him published in<em>Ancient History Encyclopedia</em>:    <a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> "When the ancient
    cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia were discovered and deciphered in the late
    19<sup>th</sup> century CE, they would literally transform human
    understanding of history."
</p>
<p>
    How did they transform mankind's understanding of history? Mark explains,
    "Prior to their discovery the Bible was considered the oldest and most
    authoritative book in the world. The brilliant scholar and translator
    George Smith (1840-1876 CE) changed the understanding of history with his
    translation of <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> in 1872 CE. This translation
    allowed other cuneiform tablets to be interpreted which overturned the
    traditional understanding of the biblical version of history and made room
    for scholarly, objective explanations of history to move forward."
</p>
<p>
    How did <em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em> and other cuneiform tablets replace
    the Bible's version of history? Mark continues: "Many biblical texts were
    thought to be original until cuneiform was deciphered. The Fall of Man and
    the Great Flood were understood as literal events in human history dictated
    by God to the author (or authors) of Genesis but were now recognized as
    Mesopotamian myths in <em>The Myth of Etana</em> and the <em>Atrahasis</em>
    which Hebrew scribes had embellished. The Garden of Eden could now be
    understood as a myth derived from <em>The Enuma Elish</em> and other
    Mesopotamian works. The Book of Job, far from being an actual historical
    account of an individual's unjust suffering, could now be recognized as a
    literary piece belonging to a Mesopotamian tradition following the
    discovery of the earlier <em>Ludlul-Bel-Nimegi</em> text which relates a
    similar story."
</p>
<p>
    Wait a minute! Mark is saying that the stories found in the Torah written
    or edited by Moses during Israel's 40 years of wilderness wandering and
    taught by Christians as authentic revelations from God is a false
    explanation of their origin. Rather, he says, they were Mesopotamian myths
    that preceded Moses who borrowed and embellished them. But couldn't it be
    the other way around? Couldn't those biblical events have just as well
    happened first and over the millennia as they were told and retold, they
    were distorted into the recorded Mesopotamian myths? The dates of those
    tablets and the actual stories were millennia apart. The tablet translated
    by George Smith dated to the early 2<sup>nd</sup> millennium BC. The Flood
    occurred over two millennia before and those stories of Adam and Eve and
    the Fall occurred about four millennia before the date of the tablets Smith
    translated. If the Babylonian myths reflected true events that happened
    millennia before, wouldn't they be greatly distorted as they were told and
    retold for those thousands of years?
</p>
<p>
    Even more important the quality of the Babylonian stories is childish in
    comparison with these stores recorded in the Bible. These scholars who are
    making room for objective explanations of history don't spend much time
    with the details of those Babylonian myths. Gilgamesh's record of the ark,
    for instance, describes it as a cube, 100 x 100 x 100. How long would its
    passengers last as this cube tumbled in the waters of the Great Flood? But,
    of course, it is just a myth so it is not surprising that its details are
    ridiculous. Why don't these critics examine the details of the biblical
    story of the Flood? They would quickly learn that the dimensions of the
    Bible's Ark are as up to date as those of today's ocean-going freighters.
    The two-page story about the undeserved suffering of a Babylonian man has
    the quality of a grade schooler's composition when compared with the
    forty-two chapters of the Book of Job and its host of brilliant ideas.
</p>
<p>
    Mark has it backwards. As the stories of early human history beginning with
    Adam were told and retold, they would have become more and more distorted
    until they landed in the writings of ancient Mesopotamia millennia later as
    myths and legends. Mark's explanation is the idea of scientific evolution
    applied to the field of ancient literature-things working their way to
    perfection rather than drifting downhill. Anyone working in the legal field
    of court testimony knows the difficulty of a witness keeping his facts
    straight. Repeating second hand information becomes even less reliable and
    third hand information is frequently dismissed as uncertain. Gilgamesh's
    exploits placed side by side with Holy Scripture are as different as night
    and day, as great as the difference between children playing soccer on a
    vacant lot and a contest between leading professional soccer teams.
</p>
<p>
    The on-line Ancient History Encyclopedia carrying Mark's piece was founded
    in 2009 with the mission of improving history education worldwide. Its
    vision is to create open-minded and tolerant societies. It endeavors to
    help teachers, students and schools by providing reliable resources for
    free. It is now the largest and most popular history encyclopedia on the
    internet, recommended by the likes of Oxford, Michigan State and the
    University of Minnesota. How alarming that the world's largest and most
    popular history encyclopedia on the internet is publishing such
    disinformation. But one thing the article does do is highlight just how
    superior the record of Scripture is over the clouded minds of those captive
    to the enemy.
</p>
<p>
    This book, <em>The Hidden Beauty of Hebrew Genealogies</em>, is not about
    what the many learned disciplines say although they say much. Nor does it
    put a spin on what the Bible reveals. Rather it carefully examines in great
    detail the very Word of God on the subject. An enormous amount of material
    has been examined. Consistently and without exception, Scripture supports
    the premise of this book. At the same time support against it has
    evaporated into thin air. In the end it is the case against it that is
    missing. So for seventeen chapters this book has focused primarily on just
    one source-Scripture. Most will confess to shock in finding that as many as
    55 generations and maybe even more were omitted from Shem's genealogy, but
    the examination of Scripture leads to such a conclusion.
</p>
<p>
    Why wasn't this book written long before by any of the tens of thousands of
    capable Bible scholars? Why wasn't it written even as early as the Church
    Fathers? This book is filled with the answers-the deficiency of Exodus
    12:40, historical errors, ignorance of the Dead Sea Scrolls, lack of
    creation models for the Flood and ignorance of the Ice Age. The Church
    Fathers had none of these resources to assist them. Neither did Ussher,
    Newton or the KJV translators. Rather, these resources are all recent. As
    they came to light, they led to corrections of misinterpretations of
    Scripture. In effect God has used in recent times an army of folks in
    various disciplines to provide the raw material for this book. Our hat is
    off to them. So the current picture allows for this book and the many
    others that will surely follow.
