<h2>
    Historical Errors Obscuring Shem's Line
</h2>
<p>
    Observed throughout this book is the fact that noted scholar and archbishop
    James Ussher was derailed by his sources. While some folks maintain he had
    better sources that have been lost since his day, just the opposite is the
    case. He adopted a wrong date for the Flood because his sources failed him.
    Today's Bible students need not be bound by his inferior sources and
    resulting weak interpretations. This chapter looks at historical errors
    which led to his incorrect Flood date while the next chapter identifies
    errors of interpretation that resulted from forcing the incorrect Flood
    date on Scripture. While most of these bad ideas have been mentioned,
    several will be examined in considerable detail. But to start, here is one
    not previously told, a humorous one involving the Father of History
    himself, Herodotus.
</p>
<h3>
    1. Inflated Numbers Regarding Pharaoh Khufu's Tomb
</h3>
<p>
    History reports that 100,000 slaves labored 20 years to construct Pharaoh
    Khufu's tomb called the Great Pyramid located near Cairo Egypt. The famous
    Greek historian Herodotus whom Cicero called the Father of History
    memorialized this historical blunder. Although born in Turkey during the
    Persian Empire Herodotus became a contemporary of Socrates in democratic
    Athens. About 450 B.C. he toured Egypt and saw the Great Pyramid. His
    Egyptian guide told him 100,000 slaves labored 20 years to build the
    pyramid. Herodotus marveled at the ego of a man who would expend such vast
    resources to build his tomb. He said the Egyptians still hated Khufu for
    forcing them to raise the pyramid and could barely bring themselves to
    speak his name. The historian carefully preserved those statistics for
    posterity. For 24 centuries his statistics were repeated as fact millions
    of times over.
</p>
<p>
    Now the truth is out-no slaves, no 20 years and no 100,000 workers.
    Herodotus swung three times and struck out. In recent years new ways have
    been found to get at the facts of pyramid construction such as studying the
    remains of villages where the pyramid workers lived. An architectural firm
    that provides project management services for massive projects around the
    globe worked with archaeologists to research the issue. Their findings were
    published in the June 1999 issue of Civil Engineering Magazine under the
    title
    <em>
Program Management B.C.        <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><strong>[1]</strong></a>
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    Working closely with leading Egyptologists in both Egypt and the United
    States, the team concluded that a paid full-time work force of 14,000
    completed the Great Pyramid in under ten years. Five thousand of these were
    highly skilled-miners who extracted stones from quarries; stone cutters who
    shaped each block on site; masons who prepared the mortar; carpenters who
    built the transport sledges and other tools; scribes who recorded
    everything; soldiers who organized and supervised the work force; and most
    importantly, the officials and planners who brought the largest structure
    ever made by man within one tenth of a degree of true north-three years to
    prepare the site, five years for construction and two years for the
    finishing touches.
</p>
<p>
    Assisting the full-time professionals, skilled craftsmen and general labor
    force were the 26,000 seasonal workers who transported the two and a half
    ton stones from the nearby quarries to the site and then moved them up to
    their place in the pyramid. Debate surrounds these temporary laborers.
    Pharaoh was believed to be a god and, therefore, all his subjects would
    benefit from his successful advance into the afterlife. On the other hand
    were tax levies. Farmers idled by the annual inundation of the Nile
    provided a large labor force. Regardless of how willingly they worked on
    the pyramid, they were well cared for by ancient standards. Regulations
    have been found covering the maximum amount of work allowed per day, the
    wages received and holidays each worker was entitled to. They were well
    fed. Their rations included two jugs of beer a day. Animal bones in garbage
    dumps brought the calculation of 4000 pounds of fresh meat provided daily.
    They probably ate better for this short time than during the entire rest of
    the year.
</p>
<p>
    A recent movie used a half-mile ramp on which to move the huge stones up
    into place. It's a good thing Hollywood was not in charge of the project
    because their method would have taken more material for the ramp than for
    the pyramid! Archaeologists discovered remarkable efficiencies-the ramps
    would have been a part of the pyramid itself-switchbacks or spirals up the
    sides. Rather than using the huge labor-intensive stones to fill the
    pyramids, less expensive methods were employed. One was forming chambers
    inside the pyramid and filling them with sand. Another was building the
    pyramid on a rock outcropping. A third was filling the interior with mud
    brick. These earlier pyramids received more care than later pyramids which
    were smaller, less well built and often hastily constructed.
</p>
<p>
    As to Herodotus, modern historians are remarkably forgiving, explaining
    that it shouldn't be surprising that he got it wrong because by the time he
    visited the site the structure was already twenty centuries old and much of
    the truth about it was shrouded in the mists of history, concluding,
"Indeed, many of the stories Herodotus relates to us are probably false!"    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Of how many ancient
    authorities whom Ussher consulted could this be said?
</p>
<p>
    This obvious historical blunder, while totally secular in nature and
    unrelated to the Bible, has an application to our subject, Ussher's 2348 BC
    Flood date. Clearly it is a matter of sheer faith to claim that Ussher had
    better sources than are available today. Herodotus' blunder, repeated for
    over 2000 years, advises us to take Ussher's writings with caution. It also
    has a second application, one to do with early post-Flood populations which
    will be addressed in a later chapter.
</p>
<h3>
    2. Deficient Text of Exodus 12:40
</h3>
<p>
    Biblical scholars of the past failed to recognize the many missing
    generations between Amram and Aaron partly because of a deficiency in the
    Masoretic Text of Exodus 12:40. This error in the transmission of the text
    allowed the view that 430-years elapsed from Abraham's arrival in Canaan
    until the Exodus and that Israel was in Egypt only 215-years. Ussher was a
    victim of his times and perpetuated that mistake in his chronology. Two
    centuries later Keil and Delitzsch could write that hardly an eminent
    Hebraist remains that still holds to the wrong text of Exodus 12:40.
</p>
<p>
    Nearly 150 years since Keil and Delitzsch issued their commentary on
    Exodus, devout Christians are still writing books stating that the
    deficiency in the text of Exodus 12:40 is the correct translation. They
    stand with the KJV which reads "Now the sojourn of the sons of Israel, who
    dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years" (KJV). Because this
    translation says that the sons of Israel sojourned 430-years, not that they
    sojourned in Egypt 430-years, they argue that the location of the sojourn
    was Canaan as well as Egypt. From this incorrect rendering they spin an
    entire web of misinterpretations to conclude that the Flood happened in
    2348 BC or so. It took about twenty errors to end up with that conclusion
    and that is why this book is so long. Each error is a battle in this web of
    errors leading to that faulty date.
</p>
<p>
    The correct text should read something like the ESV: "The time that the
    people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years" (Exodus 12:40). Hundreds of
    English translations read this way. Obviously, this reading leaves no room
    for ambiguity. As to how this affects our subject, once the text of Exodus
    12:40 was clarified all could see that more generations than Kohath's and
    Amram's stood between Levi and Aaron. With this, biblical scholars
    recognized the practice of abbreviating Hebrew genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    Some might be shocked, thinking that we are criticizing the Bible. This
    historical error and the next two pertain to the transmission of Scripture,
    not the writing of Scripture. The doctrine of inerrancy pertains only to
    the original authors who were enabled by the Holy Spirit to be without
    error in what they wrote. Through the ages the Scriptures have been copied
    by generation after generation of scribes, mostly as faithfully as
    possible. But scribal errors as well as deliberate changes, which will be
    seen next, entered the original writings on occasion to produce the
    incorrect views and interpretations we address. Nevertheless, the standard
    Bible translations through the ages have always been adequate enough to
    lead people to Christ and teach them how to live a godly life.
</p>
<h3>
    3. Addition of "and in the land of Canaan" in the LXX
</h3>
<p>
    Due to the above early corruption of the text of Exodus 12:40, it is not
    surprising that "and in the land of Canaan" was added to the LXX so that
    the 430-year sojourn would clearly span both the time in Egypt and the time
    in Canaan. Below is an example of how a verse in the LXX OT went through
    two languages to get to English. First the Hebrew text is reproduced. Next,
    the Hebrew was translated into the Koine Greek to produce the Septuagint
    (LXX) about 250 BC. Then the Greek LXX was translated into English in
    modern times. Much earlier many other translations of the LXX were made
    like the Latin translation which Ussher used.
</p>
<p>
    . Here is how the LXX reads to this day (underlining ours):
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt <u>and Canaan</u> was
        430-years. (English translation of the LXX.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
E de katoikEsis tOn uiOn IsraEl, En katipskEsan en gE AiguptO        <u>kai en gE Canaan</u>, etE tetrakosia triakonta. Exodus 12:40. (LXX
        translation from Hebrew.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>&#905; &#948;&#941; </strong>
    <strong>
        &#954;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#943;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;

            &#942; &#935;&#945;&#957;&#945;&#945;&#957;
        </u>
        , &#941;&#964;&#942;
        &#964;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#945;&#954;&#972;&#963;&#953;&#945;
        &#964;&#961;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, (LXX
        translation-Greek letters with some pointing missing)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The words "and in the land of Canaan" were added at some unknown point. The
    phrase was either in the version of the Hebrew text used for the LXX or was
    added at the time that Hebrew text was translated into Greek. Since the
    Hebrew Masoretic Text of Exodus 12:40 bore its own corruption in Ussher's
    day, it more likely existed before the LXX was translated. Thus, it was a
    stumbling block from before 250 BC until modern scholars were finally able
    to get to the bottom of the corruption and establish the correct text
    within the guidelines of modern scholarship.
</p>
<p>
    So whether the Church Fathers were using the LXX which included "and in the
    land of Canaan" or the Masoretic Text with its textual deficiency, the
    result was the same: Israel was in Egypt 215-years, not 430-years; the Levi
    genealogy of Exodus six was complete; Hebrew genealogies do not contain
    gaps; the Flood happened about 2348 BC. Between the corruption of Exodus
    12:40 in the Masoretic Text which would have occurred before 250 BC and
    this deliberate addition in the LXX, the belief that Hebrew genealogies
    were complete prevailed and continue to be an article of faith to many in
    the creation movement today. By believing that the total time in Canaan and
    Egypt was 430-years, the very words of God in Genesis 15 and Stephen in
    Acts 7 plus numerous events in the lives of Abraham and Jacob had to be
    interpreted in unusual ways.
</p>
<p>
    Further, these errors led to the misidentification of Abraham's birth
    country. As a result, most everyone located Abraham's birth place, Ur of
    the Chaldees, somewhere near Haran in north western Mesopotamia-the LXX,
    Josephus, the Church Fathers, even the so-called prophets Muhammad and
    Joseph Smith. Then came discoveries at an Ur 700 miles to the southeast in
    Babylonia. Here was a city "worthy of Abraham" wrote archaeologist Leonard
    Woolley. Most concluded this really was the country God asked him to leave.
    More recently scholars have had second thoughts. Claus Westermann sums up
    the case: "[In the Bible] there is not a trace of any connection with Ur in
the south; there is only the name."    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Of course our interest is what the Bible says, which is considerably more
    than Westermann acknowledges. Like the controversy over the correct OT text
    in chapter eight, this issue is not easily settled but we would concur with
    Alan R. Millard who wrote "The case for identifying [Abraham's home town]
    with&#8230;southern Babylonia remains strong, although the available
information precludes certainty."    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>
</p>
<h3>
    4. The Mislocation of Ur
</h3>
<p>
    The call of God to Abraham (originally Abram) contained four elements. God
    said to "<strong>Go from your country </strong>[1-Abraham must leave his
country, the land he lived in, behind]<strong>,</strong><strong>and your kindred </strong>[2-he must leave his relatives behind]    <strong>and your father's house</strong> [3-he must leave his immediate
    family behind] <strong>to the land that I will show you</strong>
    [4-destination not disclosed; divine leading required]." Genesis 12:1. Four
    times the Old Testament names Ur of the Chaldees in speaking of this
    country Abraham was to leave:
</p>
<p>
    Haran died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred,
    in <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u>. Genesis 11:28.
</p>
<p>
    Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai
    his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth together
    from <u>Ur of the Chaldeans </u>to go into the land of Canaan, but when
    they came to Haran, they settled there. Genesis 11:31.
</p>
<p>
    And he [the LORD] said to him [Abram], "I am the LORD who brought you out
    from <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u> to give you this land to possess." Genesis
    15:7.
</p>
<p>
You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of    <u>Ur of the Chaldeans</u> and gave him the name Abraham. Nehemiah 9:7.
    (Emphasis ours.)
</p>
<p>
    Of the three Genesis passages only the words of God in Genesis 15:7
    specifically states that Abraham was brought out from Ur of the Chaldees.
    The Nehemiah verse merely quotes Genesis 15:7 and contains no new
    information. Genesis 11:28 says that Abraham's brother, Haran, died in Ur
    of the Chaldees which was the land of his kindred. Since Abraham was one of
    his kindred, it would also be Abraham's land. In a similar fashion Genesis
    11:31 speaks of Terah taking his family including Abraham from Ur of the
    Chaldees to go to the land of Canaan. So in a roundabout way four verses do
    state or imply that Abraham's country was Ur of the Chaldees. (The ESV
    renders "Chaldees" "Chaldeans.")
</p>
<p>
    Now for the historical blunder. The Septuagint (LXX) changed "Ur of the
    Chaldees" to "land of the Chaldees" in all four passages. This substitution
    is repeated in the Samaritan Pentateuch. The well-established history of
    the Chaldeans exposes this to be an error. Thousands upon thousands of
    cuneiform documents have been discovered in Mesopotamia, mostly in the last
    100 years. Only in modern times have scholars learned to decipher them.
    Important here is the general record of Chaldean migration. Documents place
    them in Northern Mesopotamia in the second and third millennia BC. Not
    until after 1000 BC did they come to be a dominant people group in Southern
    Mesopotamia.
</p>
<p>
    The Ur of Southern Mesopotamia also has a documented history, in its case
    going back before 3000 BC. Some claim it may have been the first city in
    the world. By 2800 BC it had a centralized government. By about 2100 BC,
    for a brief time, it was the wealthiest and most powerful city-state in
    Mesopotamia. Its location on the Euphrates River close to the head of the
    Persian Gulf accounted for its great wealth as it conducted trading from
    India to East Africa and controlled shipping entering the Euphrates.
    Semitic peoples added to its Sumerian population during its growth years.
    Thus, the Semitic origin of Terah and his relatives fit this country's
    population profile. But erosion from the Tigris and Euphrates moved the
    mouth of the Gulf further and further to the east. As Ur's prime location
    slipped away, so did its key to prosperity. Its population declined. Then
    the Euphrates shifted course and every direction from Ur turned to desert.
    Today the ruins of Ur are in a vast desert plain 140 miles from the Persian
    Gulf.
</p>
<p>
    Meanwhile many other locations in Mesopotamia adopted the name "Ur" or
    something close-Ura, Ure, Uri and Uri'm, etc., etc. Finally, there was a
    day around 400 BC when the original Ur was abandoned. By the time of the
    LXX, the location of Abraham's Ur was forgotten but the history of the
    Chaldeans was known. It was common knowledge that back in Abraham's day the
    Chaldeans dwelt in Northern Mesopotamia. So those producing or responsible
    for the LXX changed "Ur of the Chaldees" to "Land of the Chaldees" thinking
    "land of the Chaldeans" would be clearer than "Ur of the Chaldeans. Thus,
    readers would look for an Ur where the Chaldeans lived in the days of
    Abraham-in Northern Mesopotamia. Scholars then looked at the many Ur's
    available and decided it should be one around Haran (today spelled Harran)
    since Abraham's party settled in Haran on their way to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    Sanliurfa Turkey, today called the City of Abraham, was the most popular
    choice. Josephus preferred that site. A travel blog states "In everyday
    conversations, Sanliurfa is shortened to Urfa. The extension of the name
    happened in 1984 to recognize the part Sanliurfa played in the Turkish war
    of independence [1919-1923]. 'Sanli' means glorious...it is popular with
    Muslims because the town is thought to be the birthplace of the prophet
    Abraham."<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a> Muhammad
    incorporated that identification into the Koran along with stories of
    specific things that happened to Abraham in Urfa. So the entire Muslim
    population of the world is more or less duty bound to support this location
    as the city where Abraham was born. Sanliurfa is a mere 23 air miles
    northwest of Harran (the modern spelling for the biblical "Haran").
</p>
<p>
    This historical inaccuracy also tripped up self-declared prophet Joseph
    Smith. He saw Egyptian manuscripts which he said were written by Abraham
    and Joseph. He translated these hieroglyphics and called the one with
    Abraham's writings <em>The Book of Abraham</em> which was later designated
    by his Church as Scripture. In it are extremely unbiblical ideas such as
    numerous references to the "gods," creation of the universe from previously
    existing material and that after sacrificing five virgins one of the
    Egyptian priests tried to make Abraham a human sacrifice but that an angel
    delivered him. This was said to have happened in Urfa, Abraham's birth
    place and home town so he fled to nearby Haran. Smith's manuscripts
    disappeared for 100 years then fragments were found and positively
    identified. Both Mormon and non-Mormon Egyptologists examined them. They
    were first century funerary texts and had nothing to do with Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    Mormon apologists continue to defend the idea that Abraham's Ur of the
    Chaldees was none other than Urfa as the histories of Smith's day taught.
    After all, a true prophet couldn't be wrong. Brigham Young University
    apologist Paul Hoskisson presents an impressive case for Urfa being the
correct location for Abraham's Ur of the Chaldees.    <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="">[6]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Modern Harran lies in the middle of a large, fertile plain divided up into
    visible fields of green crops as seen in Google Maps. It has a population
    of 10,000 while the Harran district numbers 87,000. Sanliurfa has a
    population exceeding two million and is located on the northwest rim of the
    Turkish Harran District plain. The driving distance from Harran to
    Sanliurfa is 30 miles by the main highways none of which are direct. Today
    no visible physical obstacle would prevent Abraham from travelling directly
    from Sanliurfa (Ur) to Harran (Haran), but the topography may have changed
    greatly over the last 4000 years.
</p>
<p>
    One obvious difficulty with this location for Abraham's Ur is that it did
    not receive the name Urfa until Turkish times. The Greeks called it Odessa
    while Syriac Christian literature called it Orhai. Another difficulty is
    the disproportionate distance between Sanliurfa and Haran (25 miles) and
    the distance between Haran and Shechem Canaan where Abraham journeyed next
    (560 miles). It seems unproportionate for the first stage of the journey to
    be a mere 1/22<sup>th</sup> of the distance of the second stage. Strange,
    for sure. But if the first half of the journey began at the southern Ur
    which is 700 miles from Haran, that would be proportional (700 for the
    first stage of the journey and 560 for the second stage). But these
    difficulties have not stopped those who oppose the southern location.
    Nevertheless, this author cannot find any reason to support
    Odessa/Urfa/Sanliurfa as Abraham's city of birth.
</p>
<p>
    So, what difference does it make, whether Abraham's country was a northern
    Mesopotamian area like Sanliurfa or the southern Mesopotamian city-state of
    Ur? It has to do with the purpose of God, all God said He would do through
    Abraham in the original call. It is hard to see how that purpose could be
    realized if Abraham moved just 25 or 30 miles from his homeland, kindred
    and relatives where those idolatrous influences prevailed.
</p>
<p>
    Abraham did not reach Canaan until he was 75 years old. Those years were
    divided between Ur and Haran. We spent much of chapter three visualizing
    those years, first 55-60 years in Ur, then the next 15-20 years in Haran.
    Within that time period was his first experience of daily dependence on God
    as he followed God's leading for the 700 miles from Ur to Haran. Then in
    Haran he began learning about the true God. Hebrews says he journeyed to
    Canaan by faith (Hebrews 11:8-10). That faith in the true God was
    established in Haran. There he began building altars as demonstrated by his
    building two altars immediately upon arriving in Canaan. There he won over
    his father's house or at least a substantial portion of it to the true God.
    There he trained 318 born in his own house to be as skillful as any solder
    in the army of Ur.
</p>
<p>
    Since God was going to make of Abraham a people for Himself, Abraham could
    not reach Canaan until his father was out of the picture. Hence God kept
    the Abraham travelers far away from the destination until Terah died.
    Further, Abraham could not begin building the strongest possible
    relationship with God until he was totally away from the influences of Ur
    that continued from his birth until the move to Haran. Seven hundred miles
    did the trick. Then when his father died Abraham was prepared. God renewed
    the call and Abraham immediately followed Him from Haran to Canaan. The
    biblical evidence is convincing, that the location of the city of Ur, which
    Abraham left, was located in southern Mesopotamia, many miles distant from
    Haran or Urfa.
</p>
<p>
    But even before the change in the LXX, there was an earlier change in the
    Hebrew text. Merrill F. Unger believes that the original text, the only
    inspired text, simply read "Ur" and nothing more. Then it was changed by
    later scribes to "Ur of the Chaldees" as Chaldeans came to settle in and
    control southern Mesopotamia. Nebuchadnezzar was a Chaldean. So, to point
    to the right Ur, scribes changed the text in all four places. But Middle
    East scholars correctly observe that never, in any cuneiform document
    discovered to date is "Ur of the Chaldees" mentioned. Never. If Moses were
    using materials from Abraham or his son Isaac or grandson Jacob, those
    people would have been filled with stories of the glory of the Babylonian
    Ur and the word "Ur" would be sufficient in their thinking to identify
    Abraham's home country. Here is how Unger explains this first change of the
    original text:
</p>
<p>
    It was [not an anachronism, as many critics contend, but was] rather an
    instance of numerous archaic place names being defined by a later scribal
    gloss to make clear to a subsequent age where and what these places were
when their history and locality had been forgotten.    <a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><strong>[7]</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    When might this scribal gloss have happened? Most likely it happened as the
    Southern Kingdom of Judah got more and more into idolatry and its history
    became more and more confused. It could have happened any time in the 300
    years preceding the end of the Babylonian Captivity. This was over a
    millennium before the tradition of the care given the text by the Masoretic
    scribes.
</p>
<p>
    We started off with the change made in the LXX. But, as just shown, we
    believe the text was changed twice, first as Unger explains, then as we
    recounted, after the demise of Sumerian Ur. But even further, we came
    across seven so-called biblical arguments (and undoubtedly there are more)
    plus non-biblical arguments from modern scholars to support the Ur near
    Haran and now these must be addressed.
</p>
<h4>
    Arguments against a Southern Ur
</h4>
<p>
    In defending the southern Ur Millard lists five arguments given against it
    and answers each.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title="">[8]</a> First,
    "it is said that the southern Ur is too far from Haran." Millard argues
    that merchants and others routinely traveled long distances, that they were
    using major trade routes and gives illustrations. We think the biblical
    answer is that God was using this long distance to help Abraham learn to
    follow Him day by day and to get the party so far from Ur that it could no
    longer be an influence on them. Moving from Urfa to Haran, a distance of 25
    miles, hardly accomplished God's specific command for Abraham to leave his
    country. Urfa and Haran were all part of the same neck of the woods.
</p>
<p>
    Secondly, they dismissively note the route from southern Ur to Canaan via
    Haran is quite roundabout. Cyrus Gordon states this objection more bluntly:
    he refers to Genesis 11:31 which says they went out from Ur of the Chaldees
    to go to the land of Canaan and then reasons "by no stretch of the
    imagination would anyone go from Sumerian Ur (in southern Mesopotamia) to
    Canaan via Haran. A glance at the map shows that Haran is much too far out
    of the way."<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title="">[9]</a> The most
    obvious problem here is the view that Terah knew before leaving Ur that the
    destination was Canaan. Such thinking completely disregards the clear words
    of Scripture that Abraham was to leave Ur and follow God's direction. He
    had no idea where God was leading him or where the destination was. Hebrews
    says it even more clearly: "And he went out, not knowing where he was
    going" (Hebrews 11:8).
</p>
<p>
    Third, Millard addresses the argument that Abraham's nomadic lifestyle is
    inconsistent with the urban setting of the southern Ur. Abraham had
    certainly enjoyed all the comforts of Ur. Millard then gives many sound
    answers, mostly centered around Abraham's new purpose in life. The bottom
    line is that Abraham looked for a better city, one whose builder and maker
    was God (Hebrews 11:10).
</p>
<p>
    Fourth, arguments from the phrase "beyond the river" or "crossing the
    river." It is true that if one journeyed directly from Ur to Canaan, one
    would not cross the Euphrates River. In chapter three we explained that the
    saying of crossing the river was like waving one's arm to indicate a great
    distance. By following the leading of God, Abraham did cross the river, in
    fact he crossed it twice- first to journey to Haran and then to journey
    from Haran to Canaan. The statement is an expression for a great distance.
    Millard says "For anyone living in the Levant, Babylonian Ur would have
    lain conceptually 'beyond the river,' whatever the precise geography."
</p>
<p>
    Fifth, the Sumerian Ur is never called "Ur of the Chaldees" in any of the
    numerous references to Ur in the cuneiform tablets. We answered this
    objection above.
</p>
<p>
    Sixth, a more serious objection not directly listed by Millard but advanced
    by Cyrus Gordon is that "Genesis 24:4, Genesis 24:7, Genesis 24:10 and
    Genesis 24:29 tell us that Abraham's birthplace was in Aram-Naharayim where
    Laban lived." <a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title="">[10]</a> This is
    completely untrue. Rather than Abraham telling his servant to go to his
    "birthplace" to find a bride for Isaac, Abraham tells him to "go to my
    country and to my kindred" (Genesis 24:4). In 24:7 Abraham continues with
    "The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and from
    the land of my kindred, and who spoke to me and swore to me, 'To your
    offspring I will give this land,' he will send his angel before you." Then
    in 24:10 "[The servant] arose and went to Mesopotamia to the city of
    Nahor." In 24:27 "the LORD has led me to the house of my master's kinsmen."
    In 24:40 "[My master had said] you shall take a wife for my son from my
    clan and from my father's house." Nowhere does the word "birthplace" or
    similar word appear. Gordon has overstated his case.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, there are words in the passage that need clarifying. When the
    original call came, Abraham did leave his country (Ur) and kindred
    (relatives). But his father refused for his household to be separated and
    in effect he and his household accompanied Abraham on the journey to the
    land of promise. When the leading of God stopped, the party looked for a
    place to live. Haran was nearby. It was particularly promising because it
    bore the name of Terah's oldest son who had died in Ur. We suggested in
    chapter three that Terah had some earlier connection with this major
    trading center, possibly getting his start there and to commemorate the
    wealth he had gained there, he named his first son after it.
</p>
<p>
    Now, a century later as Terah accompanied his son Abraham who was born when
    he was 130, he found himself in the vicinity of Haran. He had to make a
    home somewhere. He chose Haran. There they lived for the next 15-20 years.
    At some point Abraham's brother Nahor moved to that general area with his
    12 sons. Then another century passed. Terah had died long before in Haran
    and now Abraham himself was 140 years old. He had lived in Canaan for 65
    years after living in Haran for 15-20 years. His brother Nahor was a
    grandfather and the scion of a large clan in the Haran area. The southern
    Ur had ceased to be Abraham's country nearly a century before. So, in
    sending his servant to find a bride for Isaac, he refers to the area around
    Haran as his country and certainly that is where the remainder of his
    fathers' house was and where his brother Nahor had moved to.
</p>
<p>
    So the references in Genesis 24 in no way declare Abraham was born in the
    Haran area but they do recognize that he had moved from Ur to a new country
    and his kindred came to settle there. Those who make this mistake, for the
    most part, even wonder if Abraham was a real historical person and
    therefore have little confidence of the details of his life provided in
    Scripture. So Genesis 24 is not evidence for Abraham being born in a
    northern Ur. Gordon's assertion that "the Biblical evidence is by itself
    conclusive in placing Ur of the Chaldees in the Urfa-Haran region of south
    central Turkey, near the Syrian border, rather than in southern Mesopotamia
where it is located on so many 'Biblical' maps"    <a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title="">[11]</a> cannot possibly be
    conclusive since his only evidence from the Bible is the distortion of the
    biblical reports.
</p>
<p>
    Seventh, the order of events in Genesis supports the northern Ur. Genesis
    12 comes after Genesis 11 that reports the move to Haran. So the call came
    after the move. We answered this argument in chapter three as well. It can
    be summarized as follows: often Scripture finishes one subject before
    beginning another, especially in Genesis. The fact that the call is
    recorded in Genesis 12:1-3 does not mean that it came after the events of
    chapter 11. Rather, the Abraham section of Genesis begins with the call
    because the call is the very reason for the thirteen-chapter section on
    Abraham beginning with Genesis 12:1.
</p>
<p>
    Eighth, Woolley's "glamorous/spectacular" finds in southern Ur swayed
    public opinion. Granted. His successful excavations certainly pushed
    thinking in the direction of his Ur. But this does not deny the biblical
    support that we have offered for it being the true location of Ur.
</p>
<h4>
    Biblical Arguments for a Southern Ur Overlooked by Scholars
</h4>
<p>
    Now we must offer a final support from Scripture, one that does not even
    appear in the scholarly articles so far examined. Stephen says Abraham
    moved to Canaan after his father died (Acts 7:4). Those who adamantly
    declare that Levi's genealogy in Exodus six is complete are forced to say
    the record correctly reports what Stephen said, but he was confused and
    misspoke. They are defending a 215-year sojourn in Egypt. A 430-year
    sojourn in Egypt means that Levi's genealogy in Exodus six is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
    While this interpretative device (that Scripture correctly reports people's
    verbal errors) is sometimes needed, much other evidence must exist to
    require its use. No such compelling evidence can be found except the many
    incorrect interpretations that require this one for the sake of
    consistency. To the contrary Scripture says Stephen was full of the Holy
    Spirit (Acts 6:5) and it speaks of his wisdom (Acts 6:10). His words must
    be accepted as inerrant and consistent with what the Old Testament says.
</p>
<p>
    Leaving Haran after his father died at the age of 205 also means Abraham
    was not the oldest son of Terah. Terah began fathering sons at the age of
    70 but Abraham was not born until he was 130. This fact also is rejected by
    Ussher supporters. Stephen cites God in saying that Abraham's offspring
    would be afflicted in a land belonging to others which is also incorrectly
    interpreted to mean in Canaan as well as Egypt by the Ussher view even
    though God promised Canaan to Abraham's descendants.
</p>
<p>
    But Stephen's belief in a southern Ur is seen in his clear distinction
    between Abraham's original country and living in Haran. Acts 7:2-4 records
    him beginning his comments with <sup>2"</sup>The God of glory appeared to
    our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
    and said to him, <sup>3</sup>'Go out from your land and from your kindred
    and go into the land that I will show you.' <sup>4</sup>Then he went out
    from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran." Stephen clearly says
    that God appeared to Abraham when he lived in Mesopotamia and told him to
    leave that country. Later Stephen calls it "the land of the Chaldeans"
    (7:3). Then Stephen says Abraham did as God directed and lived in Haran.
</p>
<p>
    So in Stephen's mind Haran was outside the country Abraham left.
    Mesopotamia was a vast area, so in journeying to Haran Abraham would have
    to travel a vast distance to leave this vast country. The idea that Abraham
    traveled 25-30 miles from Urfa to Haran in obedience to God violently
    conflicts with what Scripture actually says.
</p>
<p>
    In spite of the two changes to the text, Stephen still had the right
    concept. Abraham left his country of birth for an entirely new country that
    eventually became "his" country and, after his father died, God's leading
    reappeared and Abraham took the vast wealth that he had inherited from his
    father to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    While the location of Ur was lost for centuries of history, Christians
    today need to focus on the fact that this portion of Scripture now makes
    sense. Consequently, knowing the right location of Ur helps correct
    interpretative errors in the life of Abraham. In the same way the growing
    body of accurate information related to the Old Testament helps us to see
    the abbreviating of Shem's genealogy and solving the strange situation of
    two brothers separated by many generations, examined in the preceding
    chapter.
