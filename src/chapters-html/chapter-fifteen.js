<h2>
    Interpretative Errors Supporting Ussher View
</h2>
<p>
    Those who hold a late date for the Flood misinterpret numerous verses to
    support their view. For convenience and quick reference this brief chapter
    collects them in one place. Only the error and correct view is stated.
    While multiple chapters may discuss some, an effort has been made to
    organize them according to the chapter that discusses each error the most.
    See the chapter for a full explanation. No single writer embraces all of
    these misinterpretations. Rather, they are found throughout creationist
    literature. But generally, the most errors come with the most dogmatic
    incorrect positions. While not exhaustive this list covers the significant
    misinterpretations we have found.

<h3 align="left">
    Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 1-2 (Levi Genealogy; Four
    Witnesses)
</h3>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error</strong>: Levi's genealogy in Exodus 6 and Numbers 27
    (Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron) is complete.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : 8-12 generations are omitted between the third and fourth names, i.e.,
    between Amram and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error</strong>: Israel sojourned in Egypt 215-years.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction:</strong>
    four witnesses testify to a 430-year Egyptian sojourn-God, Moses, Stephen
    and Paul.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Error</strong>: The Apostle Paul testifies to a 215-year
    Egyptian sojourn in Galatians three and he is the most important writer in
    Scripture. There may be uncertainty about what the other writers meant but
    Paul is clear.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : the first witness to 430-years in Egypt is God himself, the giver of all
    Scripture. What the Apostle Paul said can be interpreted to agree or
    disagree with God's words in Genesis 15.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Error</strong>: The 400 years of affliction and servitude of
    Genesis 15:13 included Abraham as well as his descendants.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : God assured Abraham "As for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace;
    you shall be buried in a good old age" (Genesis 15:15).
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Error:</strong> The affliction of Genesis 15:13 was as mild as
    Abraham's and Isaac's friction with the Canaanites or the mocking of
    Ishmael at the time of Isaac's weaning.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : God revealed a far more severe affliction. It began with a "dreadful and
    great darkness" falling on Abraham. This nightmare conveyed the real
    character of the 400 years of racial prejudice and exploitation to be
    endured by his descendants in a foreign land.
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Error</strong>: Israel returned to Canaan in the fourth
    generation as God said (Genesis 15:16). The four generations may have begun
    with Levi or Kohath or maybe they were just four generations in general.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : No four-generation scheme works. Here "generation" would be referring to
    lifetimes, i.e., in four lifetimes Israel would return to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Error:</strong> The King James Version of Exodus 12:40 allows
    for a 430-year sojourn in Egypt and Canaan while the Septuagint states it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The correct text of Exodus 12:40 was uncertain until recent times. Now it
    reads, "The time that the people of Israel lived in Egypt was 430-years."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 3 (Abraham)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Abraham was the oldest of Terah's three sons.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Terah fathered his first son at the age of 70; Abraham was born when he
    was 130.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error: </strong> In Acts 7 Stephen faced a hostile crowd. Maybe
he was rattled or had a memory lapse but his words about Abraham are    <strong> </strong>incorrect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Stephen was "full of the Holy Spirit" (Acts 7:55). He spoke with "wisdom
    and the Spirit" (Acts 6:10). He affirmed that God's call came in
    Mesopotamia, that Abraham moved to Haran, that after his father died, God
    led him to Canaan and stated that God's 400 years of enslavement and
    affliction would take place in a land belonging to others.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Error:</strong> Abraham's country was Urfa or some other
    Northern Mesopotamia place near Haran.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Abraham's home country was 700 miles SE of Haran, a place called Ur.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Error:</strong> God's call came to Abraham after his father died
    and he immediately followed God to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : God's call came when his family lived in the Southern Mesopotamian
    city-state of Ur.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Error:</strong> Lot was Abraham's young nephew.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : More likely Lot was senior to Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Error:</strong> In Acts 7:4 Stephen is saying that 60 years
    after Abraham arrived in Canaan his father died. He returned to Haran and
    brought his father's body to Canaan for burial.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : When Abraham's father died, God led him to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 4 (Jacob) </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob was a wimp, a mama's boy and basically
    dishonest.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : This line of thinking derails a true understanding of Jacob's many fine
    qualities and adds to the confusion that results in support for a 215-year
    Egyptian sojourn. Jacob submitted to the daily routine of successful
    ranching while his twin brother preferred the excitement of the hunt. Jacob
    showed faith in God's promises while his brother took them lightly. Jacob
    continued to grow in faith through the years and God richly rewarded him.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob received his two wives at the beginning of
    the 20-year stay with his father-in-law.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Jacob served Laban seven years before receiving not one but both of
    Laban's daughters in marriage.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Error:</strong> Jacob's 11 sons were born in the order listed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Since these children were born in a ten-year period, as many as three
    mothers were pregnant at the same time. So the writer listed them by mother
    in two groups, before and after the resting period of Leah.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Error:</strong> After a 20-year association with Laban Jacob
    without even saying goodbye sneakily fled his father-in-law's ranch with
    his family and possessions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : God told Jacob to return to Canaan. Jacob knew Laban would never let him
    go with his wives and children because in Laban's mind they belonged to
    Laban, not Jacob. So Jacob had to flee when the opportunity was most
    favorable. Jacob exercised good, not bad judgment by obeying God.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Error:</strong> The work contract between Laban and Jacob in
    Genesis 30:31-34 marked the beginning of Jacob's final six years with
    Laban.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Laban frequently changed his contract with Jacob and the one that is
    recorded came just over three years before Jacob left Laban.
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Error:</strong> Dinah, Simeon and Levi all had to be older than
    they would have been if Jacob served Laban seven years before receiving his
    wives.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Dinah was raped when she was about 15 while Simeon and Levi were about 22
    and 21 when they massacred the men of Shechem.
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Error:</strong> Rachel died in childbirth before the years in
    Shechem rather than after them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : After leaving Shechem Jacob's party worshipped at Bethel and settled
    there as God commanded. When they set out to rejoin Isaac at Mamre, Rachel
    died near Bethlehem while giving birth to Benjamin.
</p>
<p>
    8. <strong>Error:</strong> When Jacob moved his family to Egypt, Benjamin
    had 12 living sons according to Genesis 46:21
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Jacob's list included both those alive as well as those still in the womb
    when his family moved to Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 5-6 (Flexibility of Family
        Terms; Condensed Lists)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Hebrew kinship terms express only immediate
    relationships.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : All of the common Hebrew kinship terms are used with great flexibility.
    Such terms as father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister and even the
    verb, to beget/to bear are used in both immediate and broad senses. Chapter
    five gives dozens of examples.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk53848223">2. <strong>Error:</strong></a>
    Hebrew genealogies are complete.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : At times they are condensed. The most obvious example is that of Ezra. He
    lists his own genealogy in Ezra 7:1-5 but leaves out six names in a row
    that are found in I Chronicles 6:7-9.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk53848141">3. <strong>Error:</strong></a>
    The same ten names of David's genealogy beginning with Perez found in Ruth
    4:18-22 and three other places is complete.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The list gives three consecutive names at the beginning of the time in
    Egypt, three more consecutive names at the time of the Exodus 430-years
    later and the three consecutive names leading up to David some 400 years
    after that. About 20 names are omitted so only about one third of them are
    recorded.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapters 7-8 (Shem's Genealogy; LXX
        or MT)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Shem's genealogy is complete.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : It omits generations, especially between Eber and Peleg (from 35 to 55).
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error:</strong> The numbers in Shem's and Adam's genealogies
    provide a biblical timeline of history.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Scripture does not label them as such, nor does it say or even hint that
    they should be used for that reason. Of note, the Levi-Aaron list provides
    a clear pattern for how to understand factual information about the father
    before omitted generations.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Error:</strong> There is no large decrease in human longevity
    from before to after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Those who lived and died before the Flood lived about 900 years, while
    the first three generations born after the Flood lived only half that long,
    about 450 years.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Error:</strong> Noah and Shem outlived many named generations
    born after them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The 1300-1900 gap between Eber and Peleg means both Noah and Shem were
    dead long before Peleg was born.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Error:</strong> The Septuagint has the correct numbers for
    Adam's and Shem's lists. Further, the LXX contains the correct OT text.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The numbers in the Septuagint show deliberate manipulation. They are
    artificial and thus disqualified from consideration. Find 12 other reasons
    for the MT numbers being the correct numbers and the MT being the correct
    OT text (pp 135-137).
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Error:</strong> The authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) were
    Essenes, heretics who mixed Judaism with ideas from Eastern Religions.
    Christ may have gotten his ideas from them.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : These ideas made famous by sensationalists are patently untrue. The 900+
    DSS never mention the Essenes. A list of differences separates the
    Qumranians and the Essenes.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk90634500">7. <strong>Error:</strong></a>
    The DSS tell us nothing about which OT text is the correct one.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The DSS are one of the strongest arguments for the Masoretic text being
    the true Old Testament.
</p>
<p>
    8. <strong>Error:</strong> The Hebrew verb "yalad" used 55 times in the
    lists of Adam and Shem can be translated "he had" or "he brought forth to
    birth."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The verb is in the hiphil stem which indicates causative action. The
    father's action (contributed to) causing the birth of all after him so any
    of his descendants could be named next while the years indicate when his
    immediate son was born.
</p>
<p>
    9. <strong>Error:</strong> The Jews extensively changed their OT text after
    70 AD.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The DSS show that they faithfully copied their OT text.
</p>
<p>
    10. <strong>Error:</strong> The biblical Flood was a local event.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : 80-90 times Scripture uses global language for the Flood. Nine unique
    features separate this flood from all other floods.
</p>
<p>
    11. <strong>Error:</strong> The days of creation were long periods of time.
    God's seventh day rest continues.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Each day of creation week was a normal day. God distinguished the seventh
    day from the first six. It stands as a memorial to creation week.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 9-11 (Job)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Job was a descendant of Arpachshad, Shem's first
    son and heir.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Job most likely descended from Shem's fifth son, Uz, since Job owned much
    land in Uz and a man named Uz received the land of Uz long before when the
    land was divided.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error:</strong> If the doubling (42:10, 12) includes Job's
    years, he lived 210 years (70+140=210).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The doubling of Job's years was like the doubling of his children (10
    before and 10 after). Thus, Job lived 140 years before and 140 years after
    his trial, a total of 280 years.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Error:</strong> Job lived between the time of Abraham and David
    (2100-1100 BC).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Job was born about 500 years before Abraham since his lifespan was 280
    years and longevity declined 2-8 years per generation after the Flood until
    Moses.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Error:</strong> The purpose of the book is to explain the
    problem of human suffering.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : The suffering of Job was permitted by God to reveal the true source of
    all suffering, Satan, at the earliest time. Job precedes all of the OT
    except Genesis 1-11.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Error:</strong> God told Job to look at Behemoth who was either
    mythical, or an elephant or hippo.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Behemoth was a long-necked, long-tailed dinosaur whom Job watched in the
    Jordan Valley long before the dinosaurs were driven out and Sodom developed
    there.
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Error:</strong> The creature God concluded His words to Job with
    (Leviathan) (Job 41) was either a whale or sea crocodile.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Leviathan, the only animal specifically named in the creation account of
    Genesis 1 (1:21) explains Job's suffering. He was a dreadful sea monster, a
    serpent, created by God to represent Satan and the vicious harm he attempts
    to inflict on mankind.
</p>
<p>
    7. <strong>Error:</strong> Angels were created on day one of creation week
    (Job 38:7) since Scripture says "God saw <strong><u>all</u></strong> that
    He had made and it was very good" (Genesis 1:31).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : When God pronounced that all He had made was very good, He was speaking
    about the physical universe. Angels are spiritual.
</p>
<p>
    8. <strong>Error:</strong> There is no ice age in Job. Cold weather
    conditions are found throughout the OT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : Ice age conditions are only now being recognized and the professionals
    find numerous ice age phenomena in Job, such as frequent drenching rain,
    thunder and lightning.
</p>
<p>
    9. <strong>Error:</strong> Peleg's name means "divided" and refers to the
    division of the human race into languages shortly before Peleg's birth.
    Peleg was born 101 years after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : More specifically, Peleg's name means "to divide by water" and is used
    that way in many languages. He apparently received this name when the Ice
    Age was winding down and the melting ice raised sea level to cover the land
    bridges connecting continents.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Interpretative Errors Identified in Chapter 12-13 (Table of Nations;
        Errors of History)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. <strong>Error:</strong> Peleg and Joktan were brothers in the immediate
    sense that both had the same father.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Correction</strong>
    : They were brothers in the broad sense of both being descendants of Eber.
    Peleg was born as much as a millennium after Joktan whose descendants
    populated Arabia.
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Error:</strong> The Table of Nations in Genesis 10 is a record
    of the repopulation of the earth after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> Correction</strong>
    : The Table of Nations is extremely selective giving only 36 of the
    estimated 80 sons born in the second generation and just three of the
    estimated 400 sons born in the third generation. The purpose of this record
    was to inform Israel about the background of her neighbors.
</p>
<h4>
    The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth
</h4>
<p>
    Witnesses in a court of law take an oath "to tell the truth, the whole
    truth, and nothing but the truth." Why? Without the truth a court will most
    likely render an incorrect verdict. About fifty interpretative errors are
    listed above and certainly others have been overlooked. In some way each
    error helps to defend the practice of viewing Shem's genealogy as a
    chronology. No wonder when the Flood occurred is such a mystery.
