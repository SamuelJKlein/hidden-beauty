<h3>
    Shem's Genealogy-Which Bible?
</h3>
<p>
    The first seven chapters of <em>HB</em> presents a rock-solid case for a
    huge gap in Shem's genealogy, from 35 to 55 generations skipped between
    Eber and Peleg. The omission of those generations places the Flood around
    4000 BC or nearly 1700 years earlier than Archbishop James Ussher's Flood
    date. This finding is based on how Scripture itself uses family terms,
    genealogies and those numbers given in Genesis five and eleven. A daunting
    obstacle opposes this view-many Bibles do not contain the same numbers.
</p>
<p>
    You read correctly. Those numbers in Shem's list as well as the numbers in
    Adam's list, used by so many young earth creationists to determine the date
    of Noah's Flood and creation, are not even found in a majority of the
    world's Bibles. They appear in most Protestant Bibles. But Catholic and
    Orthodox Bibles contain numbers from the Septuagint, a Greek translation of
    the Hebrew Old Testament and the adherents of those branches of Christendom
    greatly exceed those who use the Protestant Bible-1.6 billion vs 920
    million according to Wikipedia. The begetting year of most fathers in those
    Bibles is increased by 100. Even some knowledgeable creationists argue
    adamantly for the Septuagint's larger numbers. If we are using wrong
    numbers, this book cannot be right.
</p>
<p>
    To make matters worse, the Flood itself is viewed as a local event by a
    significant number of godly Bible believing Christians and the six days of
    creation as undefined periods of time. Other views also conflict with our
    missing 35-55 generations view. While entire books address the many issues
    examined in this chapter, we will explain the view and give the fewest
    possible words in answering it. But be warned, this is a venture into
    uncharted territory for most inerrancy folks.
</p>
<p>
    Up front we want to dogmatically state that we believe the Bible of the
    Reformation preserves the correct text. While the Greek<em> Septuagint</em>
    (<em>LXX</em>) is an excellent translation of its base Hebrew text, the Old
    Testament was originally written in Hebrew. To some extent a translation
    contains interpretations of the translator, so the text of the original
    language must be preferred. This was the conviction of the Protestant
    reformers who fought numerous misinterpretations based on the LXX. This is
    why seminaries that train pastors teach the original languages of both the
    Old and New Testaments. Besides being a translation, the LXX contains 14
    non-canonical books, obvious changes from the original and contrived
    numbers in the genealogies of Adam and Shem. For these reasons and more, we
view the original language text called the <em>Masoretic Text</em> (    <em>MT</em>) to be the correct Old Testament text.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Origin of the Greek Septuagint (LXX)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our story begins by rehearsing how there came to be two major versions of
    the Old Testament. In colorful language Flavius Josephus relates that
    Ptolemy II Philadelphus who ruled Egypt from 285 to 246 BC requested of the
    high priest in Jerusalem that a copy of the Torah be translated into Greek
    and added to his library in Alexandria which had reached 200,000-volumes by
    that point. Over time Ptolemy's library became one of the most famous in
    the ancient world and it's Greek became the common language of the
    Mediterranean region and Middle East. The Torah contains the first five
    books of the OT written by Moses as God spoke to Israel in the wilderness
    (1446-1406 BC). Ptolemy's request was nearly 1200 years later, about 250
    BC. Jerusalem sent 72 elders to Alexandria where they quickly made the
    translation. Because just over 70 Jews were involved, their translation was
    called the<em> Septuagint</em>, the Greek word for 70.
</p>
<p>
    A second story dates the LXX to about 280 BC. While only 30 years separate
    the two dates, the Word of God requires accuracy and truth. Evidence favors
    the 250 date but the 280 date is advanced by those who argue for the LXX
    numbers and therefore is important to the question of which text contains
    the correct numbers. This controversy is explored in much detail in
    Appendix 8.3.
</p>
<p>
    The original Septuagint contained just the five books of Moses-Genesis,
    Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy. This is extremely important
    because over hundreds of years many more books were added to it, yet the
    growing collection continued to be called the "<em>Septuagint</em>." First,
    by fits and starts during the next 150 years the remainder of the Hebrew
    Bible was translated into the Greek by possibly four generations of
    translators and became a part of the Septuagint. This was the OT often
    cited in the NT. Then, as the church age progressed more and more
    non-canonical books were added to it. This much larger collection is what
    the words "<em>Septuagint</em>" and "<em>LXX</em>" refer to today.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Aramaic Replaces Hebrew</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An impressive argument for the LXX numbers is that they are supported by
    400 years of historians including Demetrius, Eupolemus, Philo and Josephus
    before the first known mention of the MT numbers. This MT silent period
    lasted from the beginning of the LXX translation to the alleged Jewish
    deflation of the birthing numbers after 70 AD. However, it happened as
    Hebrew underwent a transformation in Israel. With the destruction of Israel
    and the Babylonian Captivity, nearby peoples replaced the Jewish
    population. As Jews slowly returned after the prophesied 70 years of exile,
    they became mixed with this new population, some of whom spoke a
    significant regional Semitic language called Aramaic (from Aram, one of
    Shem's five sons). As Aramaic words entered the Jews' Hebrew language,
    their distinctive Hebrew tongue eventually came to be replaced by Aramaic.
</p>
<p>
    By Jesus' day Aramaic, not Hebrew, was the everyday language spoken in
    Israel. Possibly only several hundred thousand Jews could even understand
    biblical Hebrew. To get along as a conquered people, many Jews in Israel
    also spoke the international language, the Koine Greek. Scholars debate
    just how much the average Jew of that day used or even understood Biblical
    Hebrew although the Hebrew OT did continue to be used by Jews in Temple
    functions, scholarly debates, public teaching and readings in local
    synagogues. Nevertheless, that Hebrew OT was the official OT text of
Judaism and in coming centuries came to be known as the    <em>Masoretic Text</em> (<em>MT</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Just before His ascension Jesus told his disciples "You will be my
    witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the
    earth" (Acts 1:8). As the church reached further and further from
    Jerusalem, it needed to speak in a language the world understood. That
    language was not Aramaic or biblical Hebrew. It was the Koine Greek. The
early disciples witnessed from the Greek Old Testament, the LXX. Thus, the    <em>LXX</em> became the commonly used OT Bible of the NT Church while the
    books of the NT all came to be preserved if not written in that same Greek
    language and remain so to this day. Fifteen hundred years later leaders of
    the Protestant Reformation returned to the Hebrew MT believing it was the
    true OT.
</p>
<p>
    Necessity, therefore, forced the use of the Greek LXX, but the Dead Sea
    Scrolls (DSS) prove beyond doubt that the MT all along was the preferred
    Jewish text. The next pages will explain why their existence is among the
    top reasons <em>Hidden Beauty</em> believes the MT, not the LXX contains
    the true birthing numbers in the Genesis five and eleven genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    Continuing, we also learn from this so-called period of silence the
    priority of God. He was vastly more concerned with getting out the Gospel
    than establishing the dates for the Flood and creation. In fact, those
    dates were so unimportant to God that they are never given in all of
    Scripture. Suggesting that a written summation of the Genesis five and
    eleven numbers is unnecessary and the reader can add those two sets of
    birthing ages in his head while reading the text defies about every rule of
    writing. This is doubly certain in view of the summation of each birthing
    and remaining number in the Genesis five list. Nine times Scripture gives
    the birthing number, the remaining years and sums those two numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Clearly, by summing those two numbers nine times, the author shows they
    were meant to be summed while the absence of a summation of the nineteen
    birthing numbers shows they were not meant to be summed. Such minor issues
    as the dates of the Flood and creation could wait until they needed to be
    addressed. But Jesus commanded the apostles to devote their attention to
    announcing the good news that "God so loved the world that he gave his only
    son, that whoever believes on him should not perish but have eternal life"
    (John 3:16).
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the two major Pentateuchal texts-the Masoretic Text in
    Hebrew and the original Septuagint in Koine Greek-the Samaritans had their
    own version. When they separated from Judah following Solomon's reign, the
    godly among them honored Moses and lived by the Pentateuch. Nevertheless,
    the ungodly leaders made major changes such as changing certain commands
    related to worshipping in Jerusalem so that they could live as a separate
    kingdom. It was written in Hebrew using the Samaritan alphabet. It is
    called the <em>Samaritan Pentateuch</em> (<em>SP</em>) and is helpful to
    textual scholars as they study verses in the Books of Moses. However, after
    the captivity it lost its significance and by the days of Jesus and the
    Apostles, the <em>MT</em> and <em>LXX</em> were the primary OTs used.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Differences between the MT and the LXX</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are tens of thousands of differences between the MT and the canonical
    OT LXX books. Many are merely matters of breathing, pronunciation,
    spelling, etc. The <em>Torah</em> is the most similar in the two versions
    while substantial differences are found in some of the other books such as
    Jeremiah and Daniel. Our concern is the numbers in Shem's genealogy which
    most creationists sum to calculate the date of the Flood. If those numbers
    are wrong, we are beating a dead horse and Ussher's date for the Flood is
    wrong as well.
</p>
<p>
    Astonishingly all but the key numbers differ in the Genesis five and eleven
lists as authority Dr. Pete Williams wrote in a 1998    <em>Journal of Creation</em> article. Further, the LXX contains one more
    name than the MT. In a spreadsheet Williams displayed side by side the
years given in the three OT Pentateuch texts for Genesis five and eleven.    <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> This involves a whopping
    146 numbers. (See Appendix, Tables 8.1 and 8.2.) In fact, of 20 names only
    the numbers of Noah and Shem agree in all three texts. Beyond mere
    disagreements of certain numbers, twelve fathers were 100 years older when
    their heir was born according to the LXX. The LXX numbers also provides a
    gradual decline of human longevity.
</p>
<p>
    Many creationists prefer the larger numbers and several dogmatically defend
    them. They charge that the birthing ages in the two genealogies were
    deliberately and systematically deflated after 70 AD in the MT while the
    LXX numbers are mostly the correct numbers. They add that they are not
    alone, that others who believe in the inerrancy of Scripture also maintain
    that the MT numbers were deflated. On the other hand, Williams says that
    both "the Septuagint and the Samaritan Pentateuch show evidence of
    systematic schematisation [British] within themselves." Is Williams a lone
    voice? No. Numbers specialists have studied and compared the three
    different manuscripts of these two passages. In noting the specific numbers
    and their patterns they conclude that the <em>LXX</em> numbers are
    artificial and obviously manipulated-devised, not natural.
</p>
<p>
    Why would specialists in the field of number patterns stamp the LXX numbers
    as artificial and manipulated? Here are three reasons and undoubtedly there
    are more. First, the birthing numbers in the LXX are uncannily similar to
    each other. From Cainan to Lamach they read 170, 165, 162, 165 and 167. The
    odds of five consecutive generations giving birth to their heirs so close
    to the same age is great. Because the MT numbers are 100 years less, they
    are spread out about four times compared with the LXX and do not raise red
    flags to numbers specialists. The Shem list, though, is a scandal. The LXX
    gives the following birthing ages for the first seven (including the extra
    name in the LXX list) named fathers born in his line after the Flood: 135,
    130, 130, 134, 130, 132, 130. The odds of such similar birthing ages are
    astronomical. Second, the LXX numbers show a consistent decline in
    longevity after the Flood with one exception. While this is extremely
    satisfying to the secular mind, it is a stretch statistically.
</p>
<p>
    Thirdly, the LXX Shem birthing numbers show an artificial pattern when
    calculated as a percentage of total lifespan. This observation is not
    apparent on the surface, but stands out when one divides the birthing age
    by the total age. For example, Arpachshad was 135 when he fathered the next
    generation. Divide 135 by his lifespan of 438. The answer, 23.9%, tells how
    far he was into his total years when he fathered the next generation. The
    first four names (Arpachshad, Cainan, Shelah and Eber) show these
    percentages: <a name="_Hlk85366964">23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6% </a>and
    this in spite of LXX adjustments in total ages to show gradual reduction in
    longevity. The next four names show these percentages: 38.3%, 38.9%, 39.4%
    and 38.0% in spite of an increase in Nahor's longevity. The artificial
    nature of these numbers is obvious-four consecutive names with percentages
    between 23.9% and 28.3% and the very next four names with percentages
    between 38.0% and 39.4%.
</p>
<p>
    If using today's average lifespan of 70 years, these numbers would read
    16.7%, 19.8%, 19.8% and 18.6% for the first four names and 26.8%, 27.3%,
    27.6% and 23.9% for the second four names. By comparison the MT percentages
    are 8.0%, 6.9% and 7.3% for the three names and 12.6%, 13.4% and 13.0% for
    the next three. This is consistent with the contention of this book that
    following the first three names is a gap of 35-55 generations. The MT
    birthing numbers show that the first generations after the Flood obeyed
    God's command to "be fruitful and multiply" (Genesis 9:7) by having
    children as soon as they were physically capable while the LXX numbers
    don't show such urgency (23.9%, 28.3%, 28.3% and 26.6%). The very numbers
    of the LXX are sufficient reason to reject them.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>The Dead Sea Scrolls</strong>
</p>
<p>
    But the very best evidence, however, to uphold the MT as the correct OT
    text is the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). Those who weigh the MT
    vs the LXX must understand these scrolls so <em>Hidden Beauty</em> devotes
    many pages to their content, the Qumran community and distortions by
    sensationalists. See Appendix 8.4 - 8.6. In 1947 Bedouin youths looking for
    lost sheep stumbled across several parchments in a cave near the Dead Sea.
    They were identified as legitimate ancient documents and soon the search
    was on for more. Over eight years searchers found 900 scrolls and uncounted
    fragments, mostly in Hebrew and written on parchment. They were hidden in
    eleven caves in the cliffs close to an ancient two-building settlement
    called Qumran that looked down on the NW corner of the Dead Sea. The
    fragile pieces of parchment had been preserved by the hot, dry desert
    climate and the darkness of the caves. This discovery is variously called
    the greatest archaeological event of the 20<sup>th</sup> century and the
    greatest finding of ancient documents of all time.
</p>
<p>
    Searchers found fragments of every book of the OT except Esther. Textual
    scholars began studying the manuscripts as soon as they realized the
    scrolls were genuine and have been studying them ever since. A growing list
    of insights have developed over the intervening 70 years of study and the
    more recent discovery of scrolls at six other Judean Desert locations.
    Seven hundred of the original scrolls are non-biblical sacred writings.
    They give a new understanding of the religious life of Israel during this
    period. But <em>HB</em> is exploring the question of whether the LXX or MT
    is the true OT so it will focus on the 200 plus biblical scrolls as well as
    more recent biblical discoveries. First, early impressions will be
    reported. Then the more accurate current understanding is related.
</p>
<p>
    The scholars quickly realized that not all the texts read alike. Yes, many
    of them did read like the earliest already-existing MTs, but some of them
    read like the earliest LXX texts. Further, some did not read like either.
    They were sorted into piles that were similar. Eventually they had five
    groups-those similar to the MT, those similar to the LXX, those similar to
    the Samaritan Pentateuch, a fourth similar group and finally those that fit
    none of the four piles. What an eye-opener. Before, the thinking was that
    there was just a single text of the Hebrew Old Testament and copies of it
    had more or fewer mistakes depending on the diligence of the scribe. Now it
    was apparent that multiple Hebrew OT texts had come into existence over the
    centuries.
</p>
<p>
    In studying the base Hebrew texts used to translate the LXX, the scholars
    discovered that the LXX was a good translation, that it faithfully
    translated the Hebrew text that it was based on. As a result, the LXX has
    been declared an excellent and trustworthy translation of its source Hebrew
    texts. Some of the remarkable evidence for its accuracy will be addressed
    later.
</p>
<p>
    The presence of different families of OT texts at Qumran means the 70 who
    translated the Hebrew Bible into Greek had multiple Hebrew texts to choose
    from. They did not have to change any birthing numbers in the genealogies
    of Adam and Shem. Those numbers already existed in the text they selected
    to translate into Greek. The argument that the LXX numbers are right while
    the MT numbers have been changed doesn't fit the finding of multiple Hebrew
    OT text families found at Qumran.
</p>
<p>
    The existence of these multiple textual families led to further
    observations. Differences in the texts did not seem to trouble the
    Qumranian scribes. They carefully copied the texts they procured, even
    obvious mistakes. This showed the care with which the scribes did their
    copying. The two previous oldest Masoretic Texts were the Aleppo Codex of
    930 AD and the Leningrad Codex of 1050 AD. They are almost identical to
    each other. Now the DSS discovery brought to light scrolls that existed a
    thousand years before and they were remarkably similar to those two
    medieval texts. One scroll is the complete book of Isaiah. It is amazingly
    close to Isaiah in the previous oldest copy of the MT, the Aleppo Codex.
</p>
<p>
    However, the birthing years in Genesis five and eleven is the issue before
    us. With several exceptions the scrolls are not complete OT books but
    rather portions of OT books, chapters and even compilations of verses from
    various books. None contain any of the birthing years of Genesis five and
    eleven so that is not our argument. Rather, they consistently show that the
    Scriptures regardless of textual family were carefully and faithfully
    copied during the time when Israel was shifting from Hebrew to Aramaic.
    Thus, the DSS prove that the charge that Jews made extensive changes to the
    MT in the second century A.D. is false.
</p>
<p>
    The birthing numbers were changed sometime before the translation into
    Greek. So, when the Jews translated their Torah for Ptolemy's library, they
    had multiple texts to choose from and to avoid offending the Egyptians
    chose a text that had the larger numbers. Toward the end of this chapter,
    we will describe the development of the OT canon and suggest those birthing
    numbers were most likely changed well before 250 BC.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>More Recent Insights</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In 2016 newly developed computer imaging was able to read a charred Hebrew
    scroll from an ancient synagogue at Engedi dated c. 200 AD. The scroll
    consisted of Leviticus chapters one and two. The words in it were identical
    to the earliest existing Hebrew copy of Leviticus 1-2. Emanuel Tov, who
    coordinated the work of 98 scholars during his years as editor-in-chief of
    the 40 volume DSS publishing project from 1991 to 2009, exclaimed, "We have
    never found something as striking as this. This is the earliest evidence of
    the exact form of the medieval text [earliest previously existing MTs, the
Aleppo and Leningrad Codices]."    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a> Biblical scrolls found at
    five other Judean Desert locations are like the Engedi Leviticus scroll.
    They are identical (or nearly identical) to the MT. They were carried by
    those fleeing the Romans during the Jewish revolts of 67 and 132 AD and
    represent Jewish national circles that adhered only to the MT.
</p>
<p>
    More careful examination of the Qumran scrolls since 1990 reveals that the
    Pentateuchal ones were likewise close to the MT while the texts of other OT
    books were more like other textual families. In a 17-page article Emanuel
Tov, explains what was going on.    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a> The goal of the Qumran
    community was to keep the Mosaic Law as perfectly as humanly possible. In
    this effort they interpreted the requirements of the law more strictly than
    the priesthood in Jerusalem and viewed themselves as the true Israel. They
    were opposing the wicked priest (presumably the Levitical officials at
    Jerusalem) and even observed a different calendar than the temple
    leadership. They wrote the 700 non-biblical sacred texts in their efforts
    to accomplish their goal. So while they stayed close to the Pentateuchal MT
    in their effort to fully keep the law, they practiced greater freedom in
    the other OT books, showing their freedom from the religious establishment
    in Jerusalem.
</p>
<p>
    Those loyal to the Jerusalem priesthood fled the Roman war machine but did
    not take their scrolls to Qumran. Instead, they hid out in other Judean
    Desert locations. The Qumran scrolls represent various religious movements
    in Israel that identified with the Qumran goal. As a result, on the one
    hand scrolls exist that are identical or nearly identical to the MT
    Pentateuch which shows the great care given the MT. On the other hand, the
    existence of multiple textual families shows beyond question that these
    different textual families were well known in Israel and had a long
    history.
</p>
<p>
    Tov also wrote an article on the numbers problem in the three major
    Pentateuchs. He concluded that the differences are recensional, not
    scribal.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> He believes that
    the Hebrew base text for the LXX and Samaritan Pentateuch developed as one
    text and were later separated. He also views the LXX numbers as obviously
    contrived.
</p>
<p>
    Now, for another shocker. The textual scholars have studied OT quotes in
    the New Testament. It turns out the NT authors cited verses from various OT
    textual families. Tov observed that the Apostle Paul used currently
    recognized different Greek textual families for the same biblical book
    (Isaiah) and apparently under the same conditions in the same epistle
    (Romans). Paul, it appears, used whatever text was available wherever he
    happened to be. This shows that God's focus is the message, not the exact
    wording.
</p>
<p>
    To all the DSS evidence for the careful handling of Scripture, two
    unfortunate responses are found. Most creationists dismiss them. In fact,
    most have not even heard much about them. But those who have say the people
    who lived in the tiny settlement of Qumran in the midst of the 11 Dead Sea
    caves and collected and copied the scrolls are insignificant, unimportant.
    Unbelievers go even further, identifying them as heretics-Essenes. The
    Essenes had their own agenda. They mixed Judaism with heathen beliefs from
    ancient Eastern religions. They conclude that possibly Jesus got His ideas
    from them. In contrast, creationists conclude: they were not a part of true
    Israel; their scrolls prove nothing about God; mystery and confusion
    surround them; we have better things to do with our time.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Reasons to Prefer the Masoretic Text Numbers</strong>
</p>
<p>
    A plethora of misinformation underlies the thinking of those who prefer the
    LXX numbers. Our first eight reasons for rejecting these arguments have
    already been explained. First and foremost is that the DSS argue for a
    strong preference for the MT. Second, the LXX translators had multiple
    Hebrew texts to choose from and chose the textual family with the larger
    numbers. Third, the LXX numbers are obviously manipulated. Fourth, the
    changing of languages in Israel and growing dependance on the LXX explains
    why the LXX birthing numbers predominantly show up in historical records.
    Fifth, God's clear priority was to get out the Gospel, not clarify minor
    issues such as the dates of the Flood and creation.
</p>
<p>
    Sixth, the purpose of the numbers: most creationists say they were given to
    establish a chronology of early earth history. This argument was addressed
    at length in chapter one (pp 17-19). It quotes a conservative Hebrew
    scholar who offered possible non-chronology purposes for those numbers. He
    specifically stated that "The major arguments they use (for the
    chrono-genealogical view) are defective and falsifiable." Arguments seven
    and eight are major subjects of this book-the common Hebrew practice of
    condensing genealogies and the huge decline of longevity between Eber and
    Peleg in the MT. (These two arguments dissolve if the LXX numbers are
    correct. The LXX numbers contain no enormous decline in longevity between
    two generations which strongly suggests the omitting of generations.)
</p>
<p>
    The remaining arguments have not been previously mentioned. Nine. This
    argument involves a complicated grammatical issue regarding the form of the
    Hebrew verb "beget" in the Genesis five and eleven lists. Hebrew verbs do
    not have tenses. While English verbs have tenses which tell about the
    "when" of the action, Hebrew verbs have seven possible stems which tell the
    type of action of the verb. One of the challenges to the new Hebrew student
    is learning all the forms of those stems for the same verb.
</p>
<p>
    The Hebrew verb for beget (YALAD) is in the hiphil stem in Genesis five and
    eleven. It is used consistently for a total of 55 times. Those not seasoned
    in Hebrew might translate the hiphil of YALAD with "he had" or "he brought
    forth to birth." With this rendering of YALAD the student might conclude
    that because of this, the age of the father when the named son was born
    establishes a chronology. He might conclude that though names may be
    omitted, the chronology remains unchanged. With this thinking he would sum
    the Shem list birthing ages found in the LXX and confidently conclude that
    the Flood occurred around 3300 BC. By adding the numbers in Adam's list, he
    would place creation around 5560 BC. Thus, the Hebrew student would
    conclude that the Hebrew grammatical structure prohibits omitting
    generations.
</p>
<p>
    The fact is that the hiphil stem indicates <strong>causative</strong>
    action. While the basic qal stem would be sufficient for "he had" or "he
    brought forth to birth," the hiphil stem has greater force. It says "A"
    took an action that <strong>caused</strong> the birth of generation B. If a
    generation "C" followed, "A's" action, in effect, caused that birth as
    well. In fact, regardless of how many generations followed "B," "A's"
    action caused that chain. All descendants of "A" were caused by that action
    (even though the actions of descendants were necessary as well). But the
    writer felt the need to record when "A" took that action. This is where the
    confusion arises. The offspring's name is mistakenly linked to the age.
    When that happens, the reader establishes a chronology. But "A's" age was
    when he took this action and his immediate son was born, not always when
    the person the author wanted to feature was born. The named son could be
    the immediate son or he could be any descendant down the line. It was the
    choice of the author to name the one in the line he wanted to feature.
</p>
<p>
    If the author had wished to emphasize that the son was born in the normal
    process of nature, the stem indicating <strong>intensive</strong> action,
    the piel stem, would have been used. That would be saying that "A" did not
    adopt "B" or buy him as a slave or procure him in some other way, but he
    acquired him by <strong>begetting</strong> him. But neither the qal nor
piel stems were selected. The author chose the stem that emphasizes    <strong>causation</strong> and he did this repeatedly. So, the passage
    emphasizes that the father's action caused the births of all who resulted
    from his action. If the author named "C" rather than "B," he would be
    skipping one generation. If he named "G" rather than "B," he would be
    skipping B, C, D, E and F-five generations. Thus, the hiphil does not
    introduce a chronology. Because of the hiphil those from Green to Unger who
    taught Hebrew for a lifetime knew they are on solid ground when they state
    that names were omitted in the lists.
</p>
<p>
    Believers who subscribe to the inerrancy of Scripture are to be commended
    as they try to take the literal meaning of the words their translations
    use. But since the Hebrew verb form can, to some extent, be lost in the
    translation, Scripture must be read with care. To this extent those who
    read a translation of the Hebrew are dependent on Hebrew scholars. Why four
    paragraphs on the hiphil not supporting the chronological argument? It is
    because creationists have been inundated with articles on Genesis five and
    eleven being chronologies. Those lists are even given a special
    name-chronogenealogies. In effect, those well read in creationist
    literature have been brainwashed as this idea has been repeated over and
    over so it could take multiple explanations using different words to plant
    the correct meaning in their minds.
</p>
<p>
    Ten. The DSS are first hand documents in existence today. Conversely, the
    actual texts of many of the various external witnesses to the LXX numbers
    during the 400 silent years such as Demetrius, Eupolemus and Philo are not
    available for independent verification. They cannot be checked to determine
    if their statements are consistent, in proper context and not somehow
    compromised. Rules of evidence prefer a physical document to a report of a
    document.
</p>
<p>
    Eleven. Josephus is cited as a key historical witness to the LXX birthing
    numbers but his testimony is questionable. He declared that everything he
    wrote came straight from the Jews sacred books and that he accessed the
    original Hebrew documents. Yet he was in Rome and under Flavian patronage
    when he wrote all of his known works. Josephus scholars universally decry
    his liberties with the facts. He elaborated at will and changed obvious
    facts to entertain and not offend his readers. For instance, in relating
    about Abraham in Genesis 11 and 20, he says Abraham and Nahor married their
    cousins, the daughters of their brother Haran. When Abimelech confronted
    Abraham about Sarah being his wife, Josephus wrote that Abraham said she
    was his cousin even though the LXX says "Sarah is the daughter of my
    father, but not the daughter of my mother." Without question he would
    definitely have reported the greater LXX birthing numbers as the MT numbers
    would have insulted the intelligence of his readers.
</p>
<p>
    Behind the personage was a character. Here are the facts. He was a Jewish
    general in Galilee leading a revolt against the Romans. He was defeated and
    taken prisoner. That should have been the end, but Josephus had a secret
    weapon, words. With words he made the Romans and Greeks love him. The way
    he wrote delighted them. He even wrote they all worshipped the same god.
    Various people used different names. The Greeks called him Zeus.
</p>
<p>
    In addition to Josephus' known penchant to elaborate at will, his LXX list
    does not include the second Cainan. He writes that from Adam to Moses were
    ten fathers and from Shem to Abraham were ten fathers so he leaves out the
    second Cainan. This is extremely damaging to his testimony. In fact, it
    pretty much disqualifies his witness to the LXX numbers. It indicates that
    he had no Hebrew text or if he did, it did not contain the second Cainan,
    or he wanted to delight his audience with exactly ten names in each list.
    Since the second Cainan is in today's LXX, one must wonder just how
    reliable his copy of the LXX was or how reliable today's copy is. He also
    gave three or four different numbers from today's LXX. While Josephus is
    cited as a leading ancient historian to the LXX numbers, if a leading
    witness is so defective, how certain can we be about the others?
</p>
<p>
    Twelve. Jerome (345-420 AD) testified to seeing the actual Hebrew texts in
    Jerusalem. This man was a true scholar in Latin, Hebrew and Greek. He
    translated the Latin Vulgate directly from the Hebrew. Even though he is
    dated to the late 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, he would have carefully
    investigated any tales of Jewish officials deflating the numbers after 70
    AD and he would not have selected the MT numbers unless he was convinced
    they were correct. Jerome is a strong witness to the MT numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Thirteen. Argument from the Book of Jubilees (BOJ). The BOJ (c. 150-160 BC)
    declares that 50 Jubilees occurring from Creation to Joshua's conquests,
    2500 years. To do so it changed some MT birthing years in the two lists to
    total that number but its first five birthing numbers are the same as those
    in the MT and the sixth is different by just one year. LXX advocates say
    that the MT numbers were copied from the BOJ and since the BOJ numbers are
    unreliable, the MT numbers are also unreliable.
</p>
<p>
    Scholars agree that the BOJ numbers were contrived to produce fifty
    jubilees. Still, God's law regarding sabbath years lay deep in the souls of
    His people. They were to do no work and let the land rest on the seventh
    year. After observing seven sabbatical years they were to observe a super
    sabbatical year on the fiftieth year. So, the numbers seven, 49 and 50 were
    very powerful and pleasing to the Jewish mind. Is it not possible that some
    overzealous Jew began thinking about those begetting numbers in the MT and
    by changing some could more establish Israel's early history from them with
    greater certainty? He could use the first numbers because they were small
    and would give his idea credibility. In fact, he would only have to change
    a half dozen of the 19 MT numbers to achieve his goal. This could explain
    how the BOJ came to be written.
</p>
<p>
    More importantly, the MT numbers existed well over a thousand years before
    the BOJ numbers. So, the argument using the BOJ as the source for the MT
    numbers is backwards. The BOJ got many of its numbers from the existing MT.
    Further, while the BOJ drew considerable attention at both Qumran and
    Jerusalem, it was never declared authoritative in either place.
</p>
<p>
    A baker's dozen of arguments have been given preferring the MT birthing
    numbers in Genesis five and eleven. These arguments will be challenged by
    godly believers. Some of our thirteen arguments may even be incorrect. For
    instance, the Josephus argument may be blamed on scribal errors and the
    external witness argument may be challenged. But no one can dismiss most of
    the others such as the arguments from the DSS and the pattern of the LXX
    numbers. Consequently, the inescapable conclusion is that MT numbers are
    correct and the LXX numbers are artificial.
</p>
<p>
    However, some advance a fourteenth argument for the MT numbers. They claim
    that God promised to preserve the Scripture's original text. They cite such
    verses as Psalm 12:7, Luke 16:17, Romans 12:1-2, and Jude 1:3 for this
    claim. This is so surprising that we must repeat: one highly visible Ph.D.
    creationist (and his followers) in effect says God has promised to preserve
    the original autographs. But this is not what those verses are saying.
    Rather, they concern the fulfillment of what God has promised, not the text
    in which He promised it. Jesus indicated clearly that God will fulfill all
    He has said in Matthew 5:18: "Until heaven and earth pass away, not an
    iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished."
</p>
<p>
    The idea that God has promised to preserve the original text sends the
    blood pressure of scholars who have spent lifetimes studying the various
    texts and therefore know of thousands of differences in them through the
    ceiling. It brings utter scorn on all who hold it. As we have said
    repeatedly, the original autographs were lost long ago. Errors have entered
    into the text(s) that we have today. Thus, we must compare Scripture with
    Scripture to get the clearest and best meaning. Creationists need to
    separate themselves from this unbiblical teaching.
</p>
<p>
    Those who prefer the LXX birthing numbers do so because they are persuaded
    that the Flood and creation occurred earlier than Ussher's dates and the
LXX accommodates them with earlier Flood and creation dates.    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> also came into existence because it seemed that
civilization was going strong at the time of Ussher's Flood date. But    <em>HB</em> limited its search to the Scriptures and drew its conclusions
    from the common and frequent practices within the Hebrew text. Defending
    the larger LXX numbers is certainly zeal for God, but wouldn't it be better
    to stand on the common practices of Scripture which uses family terms
    broadly and condenses genealogies?

    <strong>Other Views Needing Fine Tuning </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Local Flood View</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Believers exposed to the early pronouncements from the budding science of
    geology saw their precious Bible vilified via Noah's Flood. While the Flood
    is the greatest geological event spoken of since creation, it is a
    religious story and thus a tempting target for scoffers. And that is what
    happened. Early geologists unmercifully ridiculed the biblical Flood story.
    Those who love Jesus searched for an answer. They noticed that the words
    Scripture uses for the Flood are employed in different senses throughout
    the Bible and began to defend it by reasoning that Scripture was using
    words like "all," "every" and "on the earth" in a limited sense. They
    suggested the Flood may have occurred where a sea like the Black Sea exists
    today or possibly the Flood wiped out a large population in a region like
    the Tigris-Euphrates River basin.
</p>
<p>
    Geologists have learned much since the days of Charles Lyell, the father of
    geology. Now they know of entire systems or masses of magma that rise like
    plumes or trees all the way from the lower mantle to the surface of the
    earth. One is under the Indian Ocean. Another is under an area greater than
    Ethiopia. "All the fountains of the great deep burst forth" (Genesis 7:11)
    no longer sounds that far-fetched. Geologists know that the crust of the
    earth up to ten miles down is layered with fossil-bearing, water-deposited
    material and hardened flows of magma. These layers can be traced for
    thousands of miles and give evidence of immediate deposit. Vast amounts of
    physical evidence in the earth's surface layers confirms a global flood.
</p>
<p>
    However, believers should look to Scripture as the final authority, not
    Scripture as interpreted by some human authority. Scripture itself uses an
    overwhelming number of terms commonly understood in a global, world-wide
    sense in speaking of the Flood:
</p>
<p>
    -Of the wickedness of man and judgment on all humans outside the ark:
    Genesis 6:3, 5, 5, 6, 7, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 17, 19, 19, 20, 20;
    7:4, 11, 11, 21, 22, 23 (23 times);
</p>
<p>
    -Of the death of all land animals except those on the ark: Genesis 6:19,
    20; 7:3, 14, 14, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, 23, 23, 23 (14 times);
</p>
<p>
    -Of the waters increasing/prevailing: Genesis 7:16, 18, 19, 19, 20, 20, 24
    (7 times);
</p>
<p>
    -Of the subsiding of the waters and the exiting of the Ark: Genesis 8:1, 1,
    2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 17, 17, 18, 19, 19, 19, 19 (22
    times);
</p>
<p>
    -Of God's command to fill the earth and His promise not to destroy all
    flesh by another flood: Genesis 8:21, 21, 22; 9:1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 7, 7,
    10, 10, 10, 11, 11, 12, 12, 13, 14, 15, 15, 16, 16, 17, 19, 10:32 (28
    times).
</p>
<p>
    A dozen all-encompassing terms such as "all flesh" might be tolerable in
    describing a devastating flood of limited geographical area. But Scripture
    uses such terms 80-90 times as it describes a flood that blotted out all
    land-dwelling life. Similarly, a chapter might suffice to describe a local
    flood, but Scripture devotes five chapters to this flood. Five chapters is
    equal to all the Scripture that comes before-both the creation account and
    all pre-Flood history.
</p>
<p>
    The rest of the Bible continues this global view of the Flood. Thousands of
    years later, God said, "I swore that the waters of Noah should no more go
    over the earth" (Isaiah 54:9). God says that just as He has kept that oath,
    so He will also keep His oath to love Israel. Jesus said "the Flood
    destroyed them all" (cited in two Gospels: Matthew 24:39; Luke 17:27).
    Peter reasons of the certainty of future judgment by using the Flood as an
    example: "if (God) did not spare the ancient world&#8230;when he brought a
    flood upon the world of the ungodly&#8230;" (II Peter 2:5). Later Peter
    divides time into two epochs: "the world that then existed was deluged with
    water and perished, but&#8230;the heavens and earth that now exist are
    stored up for fire&#8230;," i.e., then&#8230;now, (II Peter 3:6-7).
    Scripture abounds with statements to the effect that the Flood was global.
    As to human authorities, Merrill F. Unger, a modern prince of biblical
    Hebrew, wrote in his Bible dictionary, page 372, "In the Genesis account
    nothing short of a globe-encircling catastrophe is indicated."
</p>
<p>
    In addition to the constant use of inclusive nouns and adjectives in the
    Flood account, nine major features of the Flood story support a global
    event-Satanic activity, design of the Ark, the years provided to build it,
    the duration of the Flood, the character of Noah, pre-flood geography,
    permission to eat animal flesh, the rainbow and repopulating the world. The
    Flood record begins with a brief but chilling and mysterious account of
    Satanic activity that worked to corrupt mankind and thus destroy God's plan
    for man. Commentators generally overlook Satan as the cause of the
    explosion of human wickedness that required radical surgery, yet that is
    the Scriptural explanation (Genesis 6:1-4) that begins five chapters on the
    Flood and the repopulation of the earth.
</p>
<p>
    The Ark was remarkably suited to enable the survival of its passengers. It
    was the largest vessel built until modern times, yet its dimensions were as
    sound as today's ship design. How is that possible? God, not Noah,
    specified the dimensions of the Ark. God designed the Ark to float and hold
    a maximum of cargo, not travel to some destination. Basically, it was a
    rectangular box which would head into the wind to prevent capsizing. If the
    flood was local, there would be no need for a ship at all. God could simply
    direct the Noah party out of the danger zone. But the Ark was an
    ocean-going vessel for an ocean-wide flood.
</p>
<p>
    Because of the wickedness of man God determined to destroy all flesh in 120
    years (Genesis 6:3). If the flood was local, this would give Noah enough
    time to make a hundred trips to the safe zone, even if it were a thousand
    miles away. But if the flood were to be all encompassing, Noah would need
    helpers and this is exactly what happened. After the 120-year warning God
    gave him three sons. But Noah would also have to learn the craft of ship
    building. Then he needed the time to train a large team of helpers.
    Finally, he was assigned the daunting and dangerous task of preaching the
    message of coming judgment during that time. The time element is consistent
    with a global flood.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture reports that the Flood continued to rise for 150 days, covering
    the highest hills and taking all human life outside the Ark. By comparison
    the Great Mississippi Flood was the most destructive river flood in the
    history of the United States, with 27,000 square miles inundated in depths
    of up to 30 feet in early 1927. Yet it did not cover all the surrounding
    hills and drowned barely a fraction of the population. Following 150 days
    of rising water, the Ark passengers could not disembark for another 221
    days because it took that long for the land to dry out and be safe. When
    the animals were released, they would quickly travel up to hundreds of
    miles in all directions from the Ark and all that land had to be safe for
    them. No local flood has produced conditions across thousands of miles that
    took over a year to return to normal.
</p>
<p>
    Another unique feature of the Flood is that the chief character, Noah, is
    ranked with Daniel and Job as the most righteous man in history (Ezekiel
    14:14, 20). In the entire Flood narrative God does the speaking and Noah
    does the obeying with no indication of hesitation or back talk. How
    different is the story of Moses from the burning bush to his striking of
    the rock. God couldn't blot out such a righteous man as Noah. This world's
    most righteous individual of the day was suitable for dealing with the
    world's most unusual flood of all time.
</p>
<p>
    As to geography some local flood proponents suggest that mankind had not
    spread out worldwide, that he only occupied a small area of the world, so
    only a local flood was needed to blot out all flesh. This argument assumes
    that the geography of the earth before the Flood was the same as today.
    That notion has been changing over the past fifty years. Now creationists
    with relevant scientific backgrounds think the geography of the earth's
    surface was vastly different before the Flood and this is consistent with
    Genesis chapter one. Since all the land was in one place, just one super
    continent existed. This condition means that man was not spread out over
    the entire globe but was found in just the super continent portion of the
    earth.
</p>
<p>
    The mechanism which brought on the Flood broke up the super continent. The
    pieces of land moved over an unknown period of time to form today's major
    continents and many islands. The mechanism that started this process, while
    not yet understood, involved a destabilizing of the earth's mantle as it
    belched vast amounts of volcanic material. The continuing volcanic activity
    also sustained the warmed oceans and a thin atmospheric haze to produce the
    one-time conditions for an estimated 1000-year ice age which then reshaped
    vast portions of the deposits made by the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    God stated another worldwide change. It is so astonishing that expositors
    hesitate to take it at face value yet it explains how the animals and their
    keepers could live peaceably on the Ark for a year. Apparently, the fall
    did not alienate man and animals. While some humans may have harmed
    animals, the general population lived peaceably with them. But in some way
    the Flood caused a nutritional need for man that only animal flesh could
    supply. While God gave only the green plants for food before the Flood, He
    added animal flesh to man's diet after the Flood. Here are the words of God
    Himself:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        [God said] "The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every
        beast of the earth and upon every bird of the heavens, upon everything
        that creeps on the ground and all the fish of the sea. Into your hand
        they are delivered. <sup>3</sup>Every moving thing that lives shall be
        food for you. And as I gave you the green plants, I give you
        everything." Genesis 9:2-3.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Yet another unique feature of the Flood was the covenant God established
    between "me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all
    future generations" (Genesis 9:12) which was sealed with a sign that is
    seen all over the world.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>11</sup>
        "Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood, and
        never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth." <sup>13</sup>
        "I have set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be a sign of the covenant
        between me and the earth. <sup>14</sup>When I bring clouds over the
        earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, <sup>15</sup>I will remember
        my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all
        flesh. And the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all
        flesh. <sup>16</sup>When the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and
        remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature
        of all flesh that is on the earth" Genesis 9:11, 13-16.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The sign of the rainbow reaches as far as Noah's Flood reached. It is
    world-wide because the Flood was world-wide. As numerous defenders of the
    Bible have pointed out, vastly devastating local floods have occurred
    thousands of times down through the centuries, so if Noah's Flood were
    local, God who cannot lie would have lied many times.
</p>
<p>
    Lastly are the multiple statements related to repopulating the world. Six
    times Scripture repeats this idea:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 9:1</strong>
    "And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, 'Be fruitful and
    multiply and fill the earth.'"
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 9:7</strong>
    "And you (Hebrew-plural), be fruitful and multiply, increase greatly on the
    earth and multiply in it."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 9:19</strong>
    "These three were the sons of Noah, and from these the people of the whole
    earth were dispersed."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 10:5</strong>
    "From these (sons of Japheth) the coastland peoples spread in their lands,
    each with his own language, by their clans, in their nations."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 10:32</strong>
    "These are the clans of the sons of Noah, according to their genealogies,
    in their nations and from these the nations spread abroad on the earth
    after the flood."
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Genesis 11:8</strong>
    "So the LORD dispersed them from there over the face of all the earth."
</p>
<p>
    These nine unique features of the Flood utterly distinguish it from any
    other flood in all history.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Day-Age View </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Vast scientific research finds the universe billions of years old. Physics
    has reached the point where it recognizes that if creation began as a tight
    ball of infinitely hot and compact matter, it would fly apart at an
    astronomical rate and in 14.3 billion years spread out to today's universe.
    In deference some creationists have sought for Scriptural agreement by
    interpreting the days of creation week as vast periods of time. They notice
    that the Hebrew noun for day has different shades of meaning as do most
    Hebrew words. One of those shades of meaning for "day" is a period of time.
    On this basis they view the days of creation as periods of time.
</p>
<p>
    To be sure, throughout Scripture "day" is used in different senses. But the
    laws of hermeneutics require the interpreter first to see if Scripture
    itself defines those days in Genesis one, and if so, to accept the
    Scriptural definition. So, does Scripture itself define the length of those
    days? Indeed it does. The fifth commandment sets up an analogy between
    man's work week and God's creation week. Israel was to follow the pattern
    set by God. This means Hebrews were to work six days just as God worked six
    days and then rest on the seventh day just as God rested on the seventh
    day.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>8</sup>
        Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. <sup>9</sup>Six days you
        shall labor, and do all your work, <sup>10</sup>but the seventh day is
        a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you,
        or your son, or your daughter&#8230;. <sup>11</sup>For in six days the
        LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and
        rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day
        and made it holy. Exodus 20:8-11.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We can first eliminate any idea that the word "day" in verses referring to
    man's work week was longer than a normal day. Exodus 23:12 is specific:
"Six <strong>days</strong> you shall do your work, but on the seventh    <strong>day</strong> you shall rest; that your ox and your donkey may have
    rest, and the son of your servant woman, and the alien, may be refreshed."
    Besides Exodus 20:9-10 and 23:12, this idea is stated in yet a third place:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        Six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a
        Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on it
        shall be put to death. <sup>3</sup>You shall kindle no fire in all your
        dwelling places on the Sabbath day. Exodus 35:2-3.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    So these three passages settle the issue of whether the days in man's week
    were literal or not. Beyond doubt they were literal. But the question
    before us is "Were God's creation days literal?" At this point, the day-age
    folks make an observation that might raise uncertainty. They observe that
    the seventh day of creation week was not framed chronologically by an
    evening and a morning. They are correct to the extent those words are not
    used in association with the seventh day. The day-age people then take
    their observation to the next level by saying this indicates that since the
    work of creation was done, God not only rested on the seventh day but is
    still resting today. So now, according to their reasoning, one of the days
    of Genesis 1:1-2:3 is longer than a normal day. In the end, they conclude
    all the days were longer than normal.
</p>
<p>
    A continuing seventh day is a crucial first step to their argument for the
    days being ages. So, they spend much time explaining the Scriptures in both
    the Old and New Testaments that speak of God offering His rest to humans.
    Then they associate those rests with the rest of God following the sixth
    day of creation week. While the subject could consume an entire Bible study
    (and pages of this book), we will state simply that each of these three
    rests was different. God rested for one day to set a pattern for the
    Sabbath rest.
</p>
<p>
    The rest God offered Israel was the rest of being a nation with their own
    geographical territory. To acquire that land, they had to fight, not rest.
    To be prosperous, they had to work the land six days a week, not rest. That
    rest was interrupted when Assyria captured the Northern Kingdom and Babylon
    captured the Southern Kingdom. The rest offered since Calvary is the rest
    of eternal salvation, gained by believing on Jesus Christ. That rest never
    ends. God gives one kind of rest to Israel and another kind to NT
    believers. Since those are rests from the hand of God, He calls them "My
    rest," but they are not the rest of the seventh day of creation week.
</p>
<p>
    God is working today, not resting, according to the words of Jesus: "My
    father works until now and I work" (John 5:17). At a future time, God will
    perform a new work of creation, a new heaven and a new earth. So the rest
    of God on day seven of creation week lasted one normal day. All seven days
    of Genesis 1:1-2:3 are literal, normal days in which God shrank millions
    and even billions of years of development of the universe and earth into
    six literal days.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps evening and morning were left out so that what was said would stand
    out. God blessed the seventh day, the only day of the seven He blessed.
    This was not a general blessing but a very specific blessing. In effect by
    setting the seventh day apart as holy, God consecrated it for all time.
    This was long before God gave the Mosaic Law. From this seventh day on, it
    would proclaim God as the Creator. To violate it by making it other than a
    normal day would be to desecrate what God made holy. Exodus 31:17 is the
    fullest biblical statement of the purpose of the seventh day. It signifies
    that God created everything in six days. Here is what it says:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        "It is a sign forever between me and the people of Israel that in six
        days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested
        and was refreshed." Exodus 31:17.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    So the seventh day is a sign. For the sign to work the previous periods
    must be days not years or billions of years. If they are not normal days,
    the sign is destroyed. While the words seem repetitive, one could say "The
    seventh day throughout human history witnesses to God as the Creator and
    that He did the work of creation in six normal days. What Scripture itself
    says about the seventh day is truly remarkable and what Scripture itself
    says needs to be the creationist's focus.
</p>
<p>
    Returning to the days of Genesis one, days are stated as ordinal, not
    cardinal numbers in the creation account. Cardinal numbers follow the
    pattern of "one," "two," "three." Ordinal numbers express the order of
    things and follow the pattern of "first," "second," "third." In arguing for
    the seventh day continuing to the present, some observe that the King James
    Version translated the days as a sentence: "And the evening and the morning
    were the first day" (Genesis 1:5). They are correct to the extent that the
    verb is not associated with the noun "day" but with the nouns "evening" and
    "morning." The English Standard Version correctly translates: "And there
    was evening and there was morning." The next two Hebrew words are the
    adjective "first" and the noun "day." In English we would say, "The first
    day." Some have incorrectly observed that the definite article is used for
    the first six days but not the seventh day. The fact is, the definite
    article is not found with any of the seven days. Rather, it is a given in
    the construction itself. This definite article argument is a red herring
    used to buttress the day-age view.
</p>
<p>
    Some might raise objections by pointing out that "Sabbath" can be a day, a
    year or even a lot of years. True, but Scripture generally indicates which
    kind of a Sabbath is meant, i.e., a Sabbath day, a Sabbath year or a
    Sabbath of Sabbath years. For instance, Leviticus 25 introduces a
    particular kind of Sabbath: "the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD"
(Leviticus 25:2). Verses three, four and five explain: <sup>3</sup>"For six    <strong>years</strong> you shall sow your field&#8230; <sup>4</sup>But in
    the seventh <strong>year</strong> there shall be a sabbath of solemn rest
    for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD. You shall not sow&#8230;<sup>5</sup>
    You shall not reap&#8230;. It shall be a solemn rest for the land." God
    permitted people to take food from it for themselves and their livestock,
    but for an entire year they were not to work it. The Sabbath year was for
    the benefit of the land. This was three millennia before modern
    agricultural practices.
</p>
<p>
    The Sabbath year had other features outlined in the entire fifteenth
    chapter of Deuteronomy. "At the end of seven <strong>years</strong> you
shall grant a release" (Deuteronomy 15:1). "He shall serve you six    <strong>years</strong> and in the seventh <strong>year</strong> you shall
let him go" (Deuteronomy 15:12). "He has served you six    <strong>years</strong>" (Deuteronomy 15:18). The word "day" is not found in
this chapter because the subject is years, not days. "At the end of seven    <strong>years</strong> in the <strong>year</strong> of release"
    (Deuteronomy 31:10). On other occasions Scripture uses the word "day" for a
    normal day. "For six <strong>days</strong> you shall eat unleavened bread
    and on the seventh <strong>day</strong>&#8230;" (Deuteronomy 16:8).
</p>
<p>
    So, when the Scripture wants to speak of years, it uses that word over and
    over. Likewise, it uses the word "day" hundreds of times for an ordinary
    day. Why should the words for "day" and "year" be understood any
differently in Genesis 1-11? In the genealogies we read "all the    <strong>days</strong> of Seth were 912 <strong>years</strong>" (Genesis
    5:8). All those days added up to 912 years. All those days were normal
    days. In the same way Genesis 2:4 states, "In the <strong>day</strong> that
    the LORD God made the earth and the heavens" (Genesis 2:4). Looking back
    there was the first day, the second day, the third day, etc. When summed
    the total was six normal days.
</p>
<p>
    One troubling thought comes with the idea that according to the day-age
    theory, late in day six when man was created was 50,000 to 150,000 years
    ago. Scripture gives us 2000 years of well-established biblical history
    from Abraham to Christ and the 2000 years from Christ to the present. Even
    those 4000 years seem immense when one considers that the current signs of
    the times point to Christ's return at any time. Saying that 46,000 to
    146,000 years of undescribed divine activity in the affairs of man is
    inconsistent with the biblical revelation of a God who acts deliberately
    and in a timely way. Let us prefer what the Bible says with regard to those
    six days of creation than an interpretation based on today's science. That
    is the life of faith.
</p>
<p>
    Many ancient people such as the Greeks and religions such as Hinduism
    believed that matter was eternal and evil. The 2<sup>nd</sup> law of
    thermodynamics states the universe is expanding indicating matter had a
    beginning. Creationist and astrophysicist Hugh Ross founded Reasons to
    Believe which confirms the Scriptural account of creation through recent
    scientific findings. To date he claims to have found 250 such reasons to
    believe the Bible. Dr. Ross is a leading defender of the day-age theory so
    he subscribes to the age of the creation if produced by God at the normal
    speed of 14.3 billion years. We believe his 14.3 billion years are better
    explained by a God who is all-powerful and compressed all that work into
    six normal days.
</p>
<p>
    Dr. Ross believes that the entire universe is necessary just to support
    life on one planet, the earth. We agree. Of special note, he speaks of one
    scientific development that might well explain day two of creation week. He
    says that in 1999 astrophysicists discovered dark matter and estimates that
    it is the dominant component of the universe, currently comprising 70% of
    its mass. It is embedded in the edge of the universe and is fine tuned to
    continue the universe's expansion which must happen to sustain life on
    earth. We believe dark matter best explains the waters above the heavens
    when God separated them from the earth on day two of creation week. We will
    know for sure in heaven, but creationists owe Dr. Ross their appreciation
    for his ministry of acknowledging creation as testifying to the existence
    of the God of the Bible.

    <strong>Extra Name in Shem's Genealogy</strong>
</p>
<p>
The DSS expose an error commonly repeated by creationists who defend the    <em>MT</em>. It has to do with a second Cainan in Luke's genealogy of
    Christ. See Appendix 8.6.

        <strong>Arguments from Meaning of Names and Symmetry</strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    A very different approach used by some creationists to determine whether
    the <em>LXX</em> or <em>MT</em> of Shem's line is the correct reading is to
    study the meaning of names. These views are held by Christians with a rich
tradition of intense study of God's Word. For their sakes    <em>Hidden Beauty</em> provides thought for their consideration, but

</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>When Were the Birthing Years Changed?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>History of the Masoretic Text</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We began the chapter with the puzzling problem of two Old Testament texts.
One is the official Textus Receptus of Judaism, the Hebrew Masora (    <em>Masoretic Text</em>). The other is the Greek translation of a different
    Hebrew textual family. How do two different textual traditions square with
    inerrancy? Scriptural inerrancy applies only to the original writing. About
    98% of the OT was written in Hebrew. All agree the original autographs were
    lost long ago.
</p>
<p>
    After divine revelation and enablement to record it comes preservation. God
    used Israel to preserve the MT as is seen in the oldest existing MT, the
    Aleppo Codex of c. 930 AD. Looking at the details, with the fall of
Jerusalem in 70 AD devout Jews sought to protect the copies of the    <em>MT</em> they possessed. Faithful copying continued for the next 400
    years. Then around 500 AD several families of priests began composing rules
    for copying. Over the next 400 years these rules would become the standard
    for copying the Hebrew Old Testament. These scribes became known as
    Masoretes, so eventually the text they preserved became known as the
    Masoretic Text. It was the same text copied at Qumran a millennium earlier.
</p>
<p>
    Some charge that the Masoretes and those before them changed the text in a
    number of ways. They point to the change from the Phoenician script to the
    Chaldean block alphabet. This is a false charge because if alphabets
    change, for Scripture to be understood, the letters in it must also be
    changed. Then these critics charge that the keepers of the official text
    added vowels. This is true. But they also added more. Originally, the text
    only contained consonants and the letters of each line stood side by side
    without breaks. At some point the scribes added spaces between words, marks
    that indicated vowels, marks to show pronunciation and cantillation, and
    even marks to indicate paragraphs. Someone also added chapters and verses.
    Who would want to go back to letters without vowels or breaks from margin
    to margin?
</p>
<p>
    But the critics point out that consonants without vowels can become
    different words depending on which vowels are used, where they are used and
    how many are used. For an example in English, the three consonants "slt"
    can mean entirely different things depending on these variables:
    salt/silt/slat/slit/slot/slut/slate/salute. But the alternative is that
    every reader must sort this out for himself, in effect requiring him to
    become an expert in this. On the basis of tradition and much learning the
    scribes were in a far better position to determine the correct word than
    the average reader. So vowel pointing actually helped to clarify the text
    for those seeking its guidance.
</p>
<p>
    Then the critics point to the explanations the Masoretes put in the outside
    margin and below the text. These did not change the text at all. The
    Masorah parva are statistical notes in the outside margin of each page.
    This was all a part of counting all the words in a book or all the letters
    on a page, etc. That certainly didn't change the text. The Masorah magna
    are notes below the text on each page that in effect expand on the Masorah
    parva. It will actually cite entire verses found elsewhere that contain a
    certain word. This was before the addition of chapters and verses. That
    didn't change the text in any way.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the Critical Apparatus is the section below the Masorah magna that
    contains questions and uncertainties about the text. They are most helpful
    as a permanent reminder of variant readings and other information related
    to the text. Clearly, the Critical Apparatus does not change the text.
    Rather, it is a reminder that some question the text at that point and
    maybe someday the problem will be resolved. While charging that the Hebrew
    scribes changed the text through the centuries has taken in a lot of
    gullible readers; just the opposite is true. The notes in the outside
    margin and at the bottom of each page along with the many marks within the
    text have helped to improve the clarity of the text through the centuries.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Transmission of Scripture</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Along with the preservation of Scripture comes its transmission. While
    inspiration is completely divine and thus without error, the preservation
    and transmission of Scripture involve mankind. While God will never let
    preservation deteriorate so the message is lost, history testifies that
    those who have high respect for God will diligently copy and translate the
    Scripture. God has always had such servants. As a result, today's Bible is
    entirely adequate to instruct the follower of God in His will. Since few
    speak biblical Hebrew today, God's servants have translated the Bible into
    thousands of modern languages. It was no different in the days of Jesus and
    the New Testament writers. Even back then few spoke biblical Hebrew. Even
    then they needed a translation of the original text. But now the Old
    Testament is available in its original language and possibly a thousand
    scholars worldwide can work with the myriads of documents to determine the
    most exact reading. The <em>MT</em> like every other copy of the Bible has
    accumulated scribal errors and even deliberate changes through the years.
    But most importantly it is to be preferred because it is in the original
    language of the OT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Development of the Old Testament Canon</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Following revelation and inspiration at some point the revelation is also
    recognized as authoritative and thus binding on all mankind. That is
    canonization. Canonization happened immediately in the case of the books of
    Moses. At the point where Moses completed the Pentateuch, the OT consisted
    of five books. They were placed in the care of the priesthood of Israel.
    The priesthood was responsible for preserving, teaching and transmitting
    the books of Moses. In time a special class of priest called scribes would
    be trained to make copies of God's revelation.
</p>
<p>
    The second clear step in the canonization of the OT came with the work of
    Samuel. Samuel, though a member of the tribe of Levi, was not a descendant
    of Aaron and thus not qualified to be an Aaronic priest. In admirable
    integrity he somehow prevented being called a priest in Scripture and most
    likely in life. But because Eli's sons were wicked and Eli was elderly, God
    used Samuel to serve as a faithful priest during that ugly period when
    Eli's sons were the official priests. Beyond that God began the line of
    prophets with Samuel. Further, as the last judge he provided the binding
    force of government in Israel. He was a type of Christ, combining the three
    functions of leadership in a society under God-prophet, priest and king
    (the judges were the forerunner of kings). Samuel trained Eli's sons' sons
    to be faithful priests so that the next three generations of Eli's
    descendants faithfully served the office of priest until the priesthood was
    transferred back to the line of Aaron through Eleazar in the days of Zadok.
</p>
<p>
    I Chronicles 9:22 credits Samuel along with David for organizing and
    standardizing the service of the priesthood in the Tabernacle. Samuel also
    scrupulously honored the canon of the Law and wrote and/or certified the
    books of Joshua, Judges, Ruth and most of First Samuel that tell about his
    ministry and David's years before the death of Saul. Samuel faithfully
    declared God's word in his lifetime so the portions of Scripture that he
    produced were likewise canonical when he produced them.
</p>
<p>
    The third period of canonization came in the days of David and Solomon.
    They were neither priests nor prophets but they expressed worship and
    divine wisdom. Their books would begin a third section of Scripture, the
    writings. God showed His unique pleasure with David by giving him victories
    over the enemies of Israel and giving him the promise of a house that would
    last forever. God likewise placed His approval on Solomon by granting him
    the wisdom he asked for and expanding his kingdom. Later, God authenticated
    the books of the prophets with fulfilled prophecy. In this way the fourth
    period of canonization was accomplished. Finally, the work of Ezra the
    priest testifies to much work with Scripture. He would have completed the
    Old Testament Scripture except for brief portions added after his time.
</p>
<p>
    Jesus refers to Scripture several hundred times with various statements
    such as "It is written" or "Moses said." On the day of his resurrection
    "Beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all
    the Scriptures the things concerning himself" (Luke 24:27). On a later
    post-resurrection appearance he said, "Everything written about me in the
    Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled" (Luke
    24:44). These are the three sections of the Old Testament. The next verse
    says "He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures" (Luke 24:45). God
    the Son called these writings Scripture. Thirty years later the Apostle
    Paul would write "All Scripture is God-breathed" (II Timothy 3:16).
</p>
<p>
    The DSS make no distinction between these books called Scripture and the
    many other religious books in the collection. From this DSS scholars
    conclude that the OT canon was not yet established in Israel at that time.
    It is true that no body of believers had yet certified a list of divinely
    inspired books. But while unbelievers may have been uncertain about which
    books belonged to that category, the words of Jesus in the Gospels and the
    writings of the Apostles in the rest of the New Testament show that the
    godly knew which books were Scripture. Therefore, canonization by a large
    body of Christians must not be confused with the recognition of
    authoritative books by believers.
</p>
<p>
    The voice of the splinter group at Qumran that disappeared from 70 AD until
    the discovery of the DSS cannot begin to compare with the voice of the New
    Testament church which became a major movement within the entire Roman
    Empire and constantly spoke of "Scripture." The community at Qumran was
    entirely comfortable with writing books of religious fiction and storing
    them beside the books of the OT. These were the kind of anti-OT material NT
writers warned about. Undoubtedly Paul had such Qumranian favorites as the    <em>Book of Jubilees</em> and the <em>Book of Enoch</em> in mind when he
    instructed Timothy to "charge certain persons not to teach any different
    doctrine, nor to devote themselves to myths&#8230;" (I Timothy 1:3-4).
</p>
<p>
    The Apostle's words "Certain persons&#8230;have wandered away into vain
    discussion, desiring to be teachers of the law [but] without
    understanding&#8230;what they are saying" (I Timothy 1:6-7) would have
    included the Qumranians' extensive teaching of the law in their sectarian
    books such as the <em>Community Rule</em>. Of the Qumranian type of
    asceticism he wrote "Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some
    will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and
    teachings of demons&#8230; who forbid marriage and require abstinence from
    foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving&#8230;" (I Timothy
    4:1-3).
</p>
<p>
    Further, only individual OT books were found at Qumran, not groups of books
    bound together to indicate they were equally authoritative. To dismiss the
    DSS because they were the product of heretics is to miss their value. But
    to overstate their meaning with such statements as "they prove there was no
    OT canon during the Second Temple [Herod's Temple] Period" is equally
    harmful. What they do show is that various versions of the OT existed
    between 100 BC and 70 AD, that scribes faithfully copied them through the
    centuries to follow and that by far the preferred OT text at Qumran was the
    basis of the Masoretic Text.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Answer to "When Were the Birthing Years Changed?"</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As reported earlier, Emanuel Tov has concluded that the Samaritan
    Pentateuch and the Hebrew forerunner of the LXX were originally one
    document. Since the Samaritan Pentateuch was composed after Solomon when
    Israel separated from Judah, the years could have been changed any time
    after that. Solomon's kingdom gained a much greater understanding of the
    history of Israel's neighbors, so seeds for changing those numbers could
    have formed that early.
</p>
<p>
    But why would the Jerusalem Elders select a text for translation into Greek
    that was only 1/7<sup>th</sup> as popular as the preferred Torah text at
    Qumran? That question can be answered by another question: "Wouldn't they
    select the version they felt would best be received in the Greek world?"
    They would have had broad knowledge of Greek thinking. They knew the Greeks
    believed in more years of civilization than the majority Hebrew text
    reported. It apparently was a small thing to them to carry to Alexandria
    the Hebrew text that recognized the most years since they knew the Greeks
    believed the Great Pyramid of Giza was built 300 years before the Flood
    date found in the majority Hebrew text.
</p>
<p>
    How tragic that the 70 had become so insensitive to their own sacred
    writings that they could not recognize the very nature of Hebrew
    genealogies, that they were about identification of descendants with
    ancestors and ancestors with descendants rather than records of precise
    succession.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Weighing the LXX Textual Quality</strong>
</p>
<p>
    As textual scholars study the two texts, they find occasional scribal
    errors in the MT that can be corrected from the LXX text. See Appendix 8.7
    for four such instances. Appendix 8.7 also explains how changes in the LXX
    directed the location of Abraham's homeland to Urfa in Northwest
    Mesopotamia instead of Ur 700 miles to the Southeast.
</p>
<p>
    Our next three chapters become a unit on the Book of Job. They describe a
    world awash in history eight or nine generations before Peleg but many
    generations after Eber. They add further evidence of a global flood nearly
    two millennia before Ussher's too late Flood date (2348 BC).
