    <strong>PART III - THE ABBREVIATION OF SHEM'S GENEALOGY</strong>
</p>
<h1>
    Chapter Seven
</h1>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Shem's List: The Ultimate Example of Condensing</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This chapter will show beyond reasonable doubt that Shem's genealogy listed
    in Genesis 11:10-26 consisted of about 45-65 generations, but was condensed
    to ten by Moses the biblical author. Thus, it is not a chronology. This
    observation places the Flood 1300-1900 years earlier than Ussher's date.
    Yet enormous obstacles hide this fact. For instance, unrecognized are two
    unmistakable kinds of change to human longevity following the Flood-the
    immediate and gradual declines of lifespans. These distinct kinds of
    longevity decline are further obscured by confusing those born before the
    Flood with those born after it. Maybe worst of all are the larger age
    numbers in the Septuagint which will take the entire next chapter to
    address.
</p>
<p>
    Simple words, easy to understand, present ten fathers from Shem to Abraham
    in Shem's Genesis 11 genealogy. After explaining that two years after the
    Flood Shem was 100 years old when he fathered Arpachshad, the passage
    continues the following pattern through Nahor without deviation:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>12</sup>
    When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Shelah. <sup>13</sup>And
    Arpachshad lived after he fathered Shelah 403 years and had other sons and
daughters. <sup>14</sup>When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber.    <sup>15</sup>And Shelah lived after he fathered Eber 403 years and had
    other sons and daughters. Genesis 11:12-15.
</p>
<p>
    The biblical doctrine of inerrancy requires that all Scripture be taken
    literally according to its literary type. The literary type here is simple
    historical narrative. Thus, we must understand that Arpachshad was a real
    person, that at the age of 35 he fathered a son and that his remaining
    years were 403. Exact numbers are given for the names that follow as
    well-the father's age when he fathered his son and the number of years he
    lived afterwards. These numbers are not fiction. They are facts and each
    fact is true. However, the verb "to father, to beget" can be understood
    narrowly meaning immediate son or broadly meaning someone down the line.
    Literally, Shelah can be Arpachshad's immediate offspring or a descendant.
    The same is true for any of the other sons in the list. If "to father" is
    used anywhere in this list for a descendant down the line rather than an
    immediate son, adding the age when he fathered his son to the other numbers
    would give an incorrect date for the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture gives no reason to suspect that a substantial gap exists between
    any of these people except between Eber and Peleg. But before getting into
    the subject we must strongly affirm that God intended that all down through
    history after the writing of Genesis, whenever someone would read the
    creation account, whether in the time of David, Jesus or Luther, he would
    sense that he was not far from when God created the heavens and the earth
    and thus not far from God Himself. In the light of eternity past, creation
    was just yesterday. The genealogies of Genesis five and eleven do not allow
    a sense of viewing God as acting so far in the past as to be irrelevant or
    merely a foggy memory. These two genealogies, rather, show God to be
    almighty and loving and that He is unfolding a plan to share Himself with
    whoever wants that relationship for all eternity. Any other reading of
    these genealogies misses their intent.
</p>
<p>
    To place this chapter in context, here is the thread of our argument so
    far. Chapter one demonstrated that the Levi-Aaron genealogy is abbreviated
    unless Israel sojourned in Egypt just 215-years. Chapters two through four
    assemble conclusive evidence that Israel sojourned 430-years in Egypt.
    Therefore, the Levi-Aaron record is condensed. Chapter five discussed the
    convenient flexibility of Hebrew relational terms such as father and son.
    Chapter five concluded by recognizing the purpose of Hebrew genealogies:
    they connect people with their descendants and ancestors, but generally see
    no need for comprehensive lists of names as the secular world does. Chapter
    six gave sixteen examples of lineages that are abbreviated.
</p>
<p>
    With this frame of reference, we can now look at the most obviously
    abbreviated genealogy of all, the line of Shem. The evidence is
    overwhelming, but is like the proverbial elephant in the room that nobody
    seems to notice. Poorly reasoned arguments explain this gap away. Some even
    elevate the idea that Shem's line is complete to the level of a doctrinal
    statement and make it a test of doctrinal correctness. Nevertheless, the
    facts point to Shem's line being shrunk by about four-fifths.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>Unpacking the Confusion Surrounding Shem's List</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The recorded decline of 225 years in life spans between Eber and Peleg is a
    clear sign that Shem's line is abbreviated. Since Hebrew genealogies (apart
    from certain lists of kings and priests) are about identifying ancestors
    with their descendants and visa-versa, not proving succession, Moses gave
    only ten critical names spanning the time from the Flood to Abraham: the
    Patriarch Shem, the first three generations born immediately after the
    Flood, the three names following the large gap of omitted names and the
    three names involving Abraham-his grandfather, his father and him. This
    efficiency saved Moses the trouble of recording the omitted 35-55 names.
</p>
<p>
    By observing the recorded decline per generation just before and after the
    Eber-Peleg entry, the approximate number of missing generations can be
    estimated. While this approach is simple and straight-forward, much
    disinformation must be identified and answered. Before this chapter ends,
    we will also address unusual cases of shorter and longer lives as well as
    those of Noah and Shem who lived both before and after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Recognizing Two Enormous Changes in Human Longevity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The first three generations born after the Flood-Arpachshad, Shelah and
    Eber-all lived about the same number of years (438, 433 and 464). This is
    remarkable in that all eight individuals who lived and died before the
    Flood each lived twice that long, about 900 years (Adam-930; Seth-912;
    Enosh-905; Kenan-910; Mahalalel-895; Jared-962; Methuselah-969; Lamech-777.
    Genesis 5:3-31). Then, immediately after the Flood human longevity changed
    drastically. It was reduced by half. This is a colossal change, from 900 to
    450 years.
</p>
<p>
    But the record gets even more remarkable because after three generations of
    living to the age of 450, man's years appear to decrease by half a second
    time. Eber lived 464 years while his son Peleg lived 239 years. Peleg's
    son, also lived 239 years while the sixth name, Peleg's grandson, lived 230
    years. The first decrease in lifespans happened immediately after the
    greatest disaster ever to strike the earth since Creation, the Global Flood
    of Noah's day. But Scripture records no event whatsoever associated with
    this second halving. And this second halving is clear; it is not stated in
    obscure language; all can read it. The three named generations following
    Eber (Peleg-Reu-Serug) lived 239, 239 and 230 years. So, are these two
    halvings of longevity truly the biblical record? Yes, the Adam group lived
    930, 912, 905, 910, 895, 962, 969, and 777 years while the Arpachshad group
    lived just half of that-438, 433 and 464 years-and the Peleg group lived
    just 1/4<sup>th</sup> of the pre-Flood group-239, 239, 230 years.
</p>
<p>
    How could there be such consistency in the midst of such change (900 to 450
    to 236)? What could possibly have happened to cause such drastic and
    immediate changes in the midst of such similar lifespans? This certainly is
    the greatest question in the entire history of human longevity. Such a
    great mystery demands a solution. No end of explanations has been offered.
    The most common is that the numbers are wrong. Such an answer, however,
    raises the issue of the integrity of Scripture and is both unacceptable and
    unnecessary. A variation of this is that the numbers in the Masoretic Text
    are wrong. One must consult the Septuagint for the correct numbers. Yet
    even the LXX shows a 33% drop between them. The entire next chapter will be
    devoted to discussing the LXX numbers but in this chapter, we are using the
    Masoretic Text numbers.
</p>
<p>
    So, two sudden drops in human longevity actually happened. Imagine seeing
    no problem with eight fathers living to the age of 900, the first three
    born after the Flood living only half that long and the next three living
    only one-quarter that long when there was no second event to rival the
    violence of the Flood. The nature and function of Hebrew genealogies in the
    context of the violence of the Flood supplies the answer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Immediate and Long-Term Changes to Human Longevity</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In order to solve the mystery of two halvings of human longevity in such a
    brief period one must understand that human longevity changed in two ways
    due to the Flood. First, it was immediately reset to half of what it was
    for those who lived and died before the Flood. In terms of numbers this
    reset was from 900 to 450 years. This was an immediate and drastic change
    in human longevity. The second change was gradual. Human longevity began to
    decrease after the Flood from generation to generation. It continued to
    decrease for over two millennia. By way of contrast, no such continual
    decrease is found before the Flood. This longevity reset was a new
    phenomenon that began with the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    What was the cause of these two changes and more specifically, how did this
    author come to recognize them? As I listened to Creation scientists
    beginning in about 1996, I became more and more aware of the severity of
    the Flood. At some point this question surfaced: "What did such violence do
    to those on the Ark; do I find any hint in Scripture." Eventually I
    realized I must look at longevity charts in terms of those who lived and
    died before the Flood versus those born after. Noah and Shem had to be
    separated out. They were in a category by themselves. This was a new
    approach to charting longevity. It showed that two kinds of changes to
    human longevity followed the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    The immediate change to human longevity is clear. At the time of the Flood,
    human longevity was reset to half that before the Flood. The genes of those
    who boarded the Ark could produce offspring to live 900 years. But when
    they got off the ark a year later, their genes could only produce offspring
    to live 450 years, not 900. And those are the genes they gave to their
    offspring, 450-year genes, not 900-year genes.
</p>
<p>
    We repeat: to recognize this change in the genes of mankind, one must
    compare those who lived and died before the Flood with those born after it.
    Eleven generations in the line leading to Christ began before the Flood.
Enoch was translated directly to heaven so he did not see death. The 10    <sup>th</sup> and 11<sup>th</sup>, Noah and Shem lived both before and
    after the Flood so they must be treated separately. The remaining eight all
    died before the Flood and lived about the same number of years-900 years.
    Since they died before the Flood, their reproductive genes could not have
    been affected by the Flood. For them, whatever the Flood did to those on
    the Ark had no impact on their genetic makeup so they gave their offspring
    genes to live 900 years.
</p>
<p>
    The very first generation born after the Flood lived only half as long. The
    same was true for the second and third generations that followed. They also
    lived only half as long as the pre-Flood individuals. There were no
    children on the Ark, only eight adults-Noah and his wife, their three sons
    and their sons' wives. Before the Flood the people who lived to 900 reached
    adulthood at about the age of 100, so that is when they started their
    families. Noah's three sons were all under the age of 100 although each had
    taken a wife. Each of Noah's sons began his recorded family after the
    Flood. Of Noah's three sons Scripture only gives the years for the line of
    one, Shem, but the Table of Nations (Genesis 10) indicates a similar and
    even parallel pattern of reproduction in the lines of his two brothers.
</p>
<p>
    Shem begat Arpachshad, his first named son, two years after the Flood.
    Arpachshad lived 438 years. He begat Shelah who lived 433 years. Shelah
    fathered Eber who lived 464 years. In short, before the Flood people lived
    about 900 years; those born right after the Flood, about 450 years. For
    some reason not explained by Scripture man's new lifespan after the Flood
    was just half of what it was before. The Giver of Life no longer enabled
    anyone born after the Flood to live to the age of 900. Further, it wasn't
    just the first generation born after the Flood that lived only half as
    long. It was the first three consecutive generations. The first three
    generations in a row born after the Flood lived only half as long as the
    entire biblical history of those who lived and died before the Flood. This
    cutting of lifespans in half happened at the very time of the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    But the Flood marked a second way that human longevity changed. This second
    change was an on-going change to human lifespans. It was primarily
    physical, something about genetic entrophy, but environmental as well, such
    as the seasons being more harsh, etc. The causes for this second kind of
    change remain to be explored, but their effect is clear. These changes,
    whatever they were, slowly drained away much of man's vitality. This second
    impact could have taken some time to get started, but it continued to the
    end of Moses' days. It resulted in a gradual decline of longevity. It is
    reflected in many verses of Scripture which establish an undeniable
    pattern. The longest recorded lifespan of any born after the Flood was Eber
    who was a third generation post-Flood individual. He lived 464 years. Yet
    near the end of Moses' life (about 1410 BC), a man's typical full lifespan
    was 70 years (Psalm 90:10). While that decline from Eber (464 years) to
    Moses (70 years) was a huge decline, 369 years, it was nevertheless
    gradual, happening over the better part of three millennia.
</p>
<p>
    Now we can see why there is such a drastic difference in the lifespans of
    Eber and Peleg. Their lifespans are simply the typical lifespans of those
    who lived before and after an omission of 35-55 consecutive generations.
    While Eber truly lived 464 years, his descendants may have lived more or
    fewer than 464 years but slowly their lifespans decreased so that 35-55
    generations later people were only living to the age of 239. So, on one
    side of this enormous omission of generations Eber truly lived 464 years
    while on the other side of this huge gap Peleg truly lived 239 years. In
    reality, it was not a halving at all, but it can be mistaken for a halving.
    By recording the lifespan of Eber (464 years) immediately followed by the
    lifespan of Peleg (239), Moses was telling his audience that he was
    skipping the names of 35-55 generations worth of decline. Peleg was not
    Eber's immediate son. He was the son born in that line following all those
    missing names. Eber truly lived 464 years and Peleg truly lived 239 years.
    But that 225 year decline between them was spread over 35-55 omitted
    generations.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Understanding the Immediate and Long-Term Impacts of the Flood
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The immediate and long-term impacts of the Flood are not difficult
    concepts. But they are new, even radical. As I reviewed the thinking of
    inerrancy folks on the numbers in Shem's list, I found three general
    positions. For instance, after reading my Executive Summary a woman at
    church said her high school/college age kids accepted the biblical numbers
    as accurate, but were uncertain how to understand them--were they
    generalizations or precise; were they complete or not? Her young people
    probably represent the average inerrancy believer who does not understand
    that sometimes Hebrew genealogies intentionally omit generations.
</p>
<p>
    At the opposite end of the scale Hebrew scholar Dr. Merrill F. Unger, a
    champion of inerrancy, did not hesitate to write clearly and adamantly that
    Shem's list omits names although he did not suggest where or how many. In
    between these poles is the word I received from Dr. William Barrick,
    religion editor for Creation Research Journal. He said that he does not
    hear the 2348 or 4004 BC dates in the creation meetings he attends in the
    Los Angeles area but on the other hand those speakers don't give earlier
    dates either. They simply avoid talking about the subject.
</p>
<p>
    So, the general thinking among inerrancy believers ranges from uncertainty,
    to avoiding the subject, to certainty that the list is incomplete. Barrick,
    himself, like Unger feels Shem's list is incomplete. In my own research I
    have concluded that not one of the world's 100 leading evangelical,
    inerrancy, OT scholars believes Shem's list is complete. The question that
    kept troubling me as I began working on this subject twelve years ago was
    why none of these scholars had published a satisfactory scheme to account
    for the missing time.
</p>
<p>
    In circulating this idea of an immediate and long-term impact of the Flood,
    I have found that about 90-95% of those who understand Scripture to be
    inerrant (the foundation of this book) say it makes sense. But the 5-10% of
    those who have spent years teaching the Ussher dates for the Flood and
    Creation find my ideas difficult to accept. Rather than giving them careful
    consideration, they typically go on the offensive. They repeat their
    arguments even though this book has systematically shown their arguments to
    be defective. In their zeal they don't even seem to understand the answers
    this book provides.
</p>
<p>
    The situation is grave. Apart from accepting a biblical solution that
    reveals an earlier date for the Flood, the Ussher thinking creation
    scientists will continue to discredit the creation science they so
    self-sacrificially pursue, in effect, shooting themselves in the foot. I
    have been asked how they discredit the very science they use to dismiss
    evolution and recognize a Creator. Actually, it should be obvious. By
    giving a Flood date that is clearly too late, their critics leap for joy,
    announcing to all who will hear that since they are obviously wrong on the
    date of the Flood, their creation science surely must be equally flawed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Credit to Creation Scientists</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Maybe the following line of thinking will help creation scientists to
    understand how important their work has been in recognizing the gap in the
    Shem genealogy. It is not unreasonable to conclude that only because of
    their work could this solution be discovered. Creationists for some 50
    years have been plumbing the violence of the Flood. Creation geologists
    have pointed to vast formations laid down quickly until they are blue in
    the face. Those formations give overwhelming evidence for immediate,
    continuous deposition, not over long periods of time. The entire earth
    bears a consistent testimony to these formations being deposited rapidly,
    suddenly, indicating a steadily rising sea level as Genesis 7: 17-18 says.
    Now with this new information revealing the incredible violence of the
    Flood, Christians could make sense of these declines in human longevity.
</p>
<p>
    Adding to the work of creation scientists, historical errors that obscured
    Shem's line are now corrected (see chapter 13). The recent clarification of
    Exodus 12:40 eliminated the 215-year Egyptian sojourn error. In addition,
    scholars have discovered how to translate millions of recently discovered
    documents written in cuneiform and hieroglyphics. And most recently, the
    Dead Sea Scrolls which show the care of copying Scripture and the various
    Hebrew textual families that existed between about 50 BC and 70 AD were
    discovered and their secrets learned. (See chapter 8.) These findings have
    helped correct dozens of misinterpretations in the lives of Abraham and
    Jacob. (See chapter 14.) None of this information was available to
    Josephus, the church fathers or Ussher.
</p>
<p>
    Those changes to human longevity may have been a direct act of God, a side
    effect of the Flood or a combination of the two. Whatever the cause it is
    worth pondering the forces the Flood released on the world. First, the
    Flood released 500 million years' worth of nuclear decay according to RATE
    findings published in 2005. It also released radon and chemicals which are
    harmful genetically. In addition, it caused rapid polar reverses. With
    thought many harmful forces could be listed. What did they do to the Ark
    passengers?
</p>
<p>
    But one thing is certain. When Shem and his wife got off the Ark and
    parented their first son, Arpachshad, they gave him genes that only enabled
    him to live about 450 years, not 900. When that son and his wife
    procreated, they passed on the only genes they had, the ones they had
    received from their parents after the Flood. When Shem's grandson Shelah
    and his wife procreated, they likewise passed on the same reproductive
    genes that were somehow reset at the time of the Flood. That resetting now
    led to a new longevity for mankind-450 years instead of 900 years. The
    first halving of longevity began with the first generation born after the
    Flood.
</p>
<p>
    While the immediate and long-term effects of the Flood were very different,
    a big stumbling block to distinguishing between them is the common practice
    of including the years of Noah and Shem on a continuous chart of lifespans.
    That practice is one of the causes of this 2000-year-old error and will
    always hide the correct answer. Noah and Shem must be viewed as special
    cases and treated separately. For this a careful explanation is coming up
    that will provide the reasons for keeping Noah and Shem from either Adam's
    or Shem's chart when viewed for the purpose of declining longevity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>More Considerations of the Long-Term Impacts of the Flood</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now for a more careful look at the second impact of the Flood which we call
    "The Long-Term Impact of the Flood." The second halving of human longevity
    could also have been a direct act of God or a long-term result of the
    violence of the Flood or a combination of the two. But Genesis 8:22
    introduces a new possibility: "seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer
    and winter, day and night." While God promised not to send another global
    Flood and He promised to continue providing an earth that would sustain
    life, it seems that this verse is stating that making a living would take
    more effort and planning, and be more precarious. It seems to indicate some
    kind of change in the annual processes of nature. However, some
    commentators understand this to be a promise that, just as before, there
    would continue to be seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and
    winter, day and night.
</p>
<p>
    Still, creation scientists favor the view that pre-Flood man lived in a
    more predictable, semi-tropical climate unthreatened by natural disasters
    and very possibly shielded from solar radiation. Now he would experience
    crop failure, four definite seasons, powerful earthquakes, volcanic
    activity, violent weather and the Ice Age. Formerly food grew year around;
    now there would be seedtime and harvest. Whereas before a more uniform
    climate extended from pole-to-pole year around, now there would be cold and
    heat. Near the equator and in desert regions man would learn to survive
    during times of intense heat and unpredictable precipitation while near the
    poles he would learn to survive in times of intense cold.
</p>
<p>
    Heat and cold would produce deadly storms and killing drought. Even more
    ominous, heat in the oceans (estimated as high as 86<sup>o</sup> in some
    areas) would produce an ice age while tectonic plate movement would produce
    earthquakes and lift mountain ranges into the clouds. Additionally, the
    human gene pool would acquire mutations that gradually reduced fitness and
    thus longevity. While the above view may be somewhat modified over the
    years by creation scientists, there currently is much to commend it.
</p>
<p>
    These changes placed unique stresses on mankind. Scripture says the Ark
    landed in the mountains of Ararat, but that name was given after the
    mountains formed. Many of those mountains are volcanoes. Mount Ararat
    itself would eventually grow to 17,000 feet above sea level and the entire
    region would rise to become a plateau nearly 3000 feet high, much of it
    volcanic rock. Rising mountains and volcanism were happening worldwide.
    These volcanoes released ash that blanketed the earth for centuries and
    lowered summer surface temperatures significantly. Migration to Lower
    Mesopotamia and on to Arabia and the southern Mediterranean brought some
    relief from the volcanic activity and the growing cold.
</p>
<p>
    If this view is correct the new world certainly contributed to the second
    effect of the Flood, although it may not have been the primary cause of
    this second effect. It seems that this second effect gradually wore away
    the vitality of mankind, producing a continuous decline of longevity.
    Because the decline was gradual and continued from the Flood until Moses,
    Shem's list must reflect it. The first records of decline between
    generations were five and 4.5 years. Such a small decline is only about a
    1% difference in lifespans between generations. We are dealing with
    averages, but averages are made up of different numbers and each individual
    is different. So, in the midst of such small changes, one might not think
    of occasional variations of, say 25 (5%) or even 50 (10%) years as unusual
    and that is true. But the decline between Eber and Peleg was not the
    standard 4.5 or five years or even 25 or 50 years. It was an enormous 225
    year decline, 61% of the entire decline from the Flood until Moses. To
    visualize all the average generations needed to produce a 225-year decline,
    the next paragraph explores such calculations.
</p>
<p>
    The first six names in Shem's list provide differences over five
    generations. The difference between the first and second names, Arpachshad
    and Shelah, was just five years. The difference between the second and
    third names was 31 years but these 31 years were an increase in lifespans,
    not a decrease. But the increase was not 450 years (a 100% increase) so as
    to give Eber a lifespan like that of pre-Flood people, but simply an
    increase of 6.5% over that of his father and grandfather. The difference
    between the fourth and sixth names was nine years or an average of 4.5
    years per generation. On this basis of 4.5-5 years of decline per
    generation, if one generation was omitted, on average the grandson would
    live nine or ten fewer years and this would be reflected in his reported
    lifespan. The son following an omission of four generations would live
    18-20 fewer years. The son following an omission of eight generations would
    live 36-40 fewer years. The son following an omission of 16 generations
    would live 72-80 fewer years. The son following an omission of 32
    generations would live 144-160 fewer years. Now we get to the actual number
    given in Scripture, the 225 year decrease between Eber and Peleg: on the
    basis of a 4.5-5 year average generational decline, that son would follow
    the omission of 45-50 generations.
</p>
<p>
    The first thought that comes to mind is that Peleg was an exception. But
    this cannot be, because his son Reu also lived to the same age. If Peleg
    died due to an accident or sickness, Reu would have lived 8-10 years fewer
    than Eber, but he also lived 225 fewer years than Eber. Even if both Peleg
    and Reu were exceptions, one would expect Reu's son Serug to have lived
    simply 13.5-15 fewer years than Eber, but he lived 234 fewer years than
    Eber. Peleg was not an exception. He lived a normal lifetime and no one
    born after him is recorded to have lived longer than he lived. His lifespan
    testifies to being born many generations after Eber. Thus, beget is used in
    the broad sense of Peleg being the son of Eber through many intermediate
    fathers. Modern terminology would call Peleg a descendant of Eber. Next, we
    must carefully document the gradual but continual decline of longevity
    between the Flood and Moses.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Specific Records of Longevity Decline</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We previously saw that there was no decline of longevity over the
    generations that lived and died before the Flood. To repeat: on average
    each person in Adam's list (Genesis 5) who lived and died before the Flood
    lived about 900 years. Now we are ready to examine the post-Flood record
    which reflects a gradual but continuing decline of longevity in contrast to
    the pre-Flood record of no longevity decline at all. The decline from the
    first generation (Arpachshad-438 years) to second generation (Shelah-433
    years) of those born after the Flood was five years. Shelah's son Eber
    lived longer than his father or grandfather and is an exception that we
    will deal with later.
</p>
<p>
    The next three names in Shem's list are the fourth, fifth and six names.
    They come immediately after the gap between Eber and Peleg. Both Peleg and
    his son Reu lived 239 years while Reu's son Serug lived to the age of 230.
    Thus, there was no decline between the fourth and fifth names, but the
    sixth named person, Serug lived nine fewer years than either his father or
    grandfather. This nine year decline produces an average decline of 4.5
    years per generation. Thus, the two periods record declines of five years
    from the first to the second names and nine years from the fourth to the
    sixth names. Apart from the 31 year increase from Shelah to Eber, these are
    the first specific records of lifespans after the Flood and they are nearly
    identical. Five to 4.5 years per generation is a change of a mere half year
    per generation in 35 to 55 generations.
</p>
<p>
    Our third set of specific lifespans comes from Jacob's record which jumps
    down to the time in Canaan and Egypt, about 600 years after the second
    measure and two millennia after the first measure. Jacob lived to the age
    of 147. His son Levi lived to the age of 137. Levi's son Kohath lived to
    the age of 133 and Kohath's son Amram lived to the age of 137. A casual
    look finds the total decline from Jacob to Amram (four fathers or three
    generations) was 10 years (147-137=10) or 3.3 years per generation. A more
    careful look at this apparent decline will be offered later. At least on
    the surface we have a specific recorded decline of five years per
    generation immediately after the Flood, a specific recorded decline of 4.5
    years per generation for two generations between one and two millennia
    later and a possible recorded decline of 3.3 years per generation over
    three generations half a millennium after that.
</p>
<p>
    Now we jump down to a clear final decline of man's longevity, from Amram to
    Moses. They also were in the line of Levi. While the final notice of
    decline was Psalm 90:10 in which Moses wrote that man's lifespan would be
    70 or 80, these lifespans reflected the judgment of God on Israel's
    unbelief and the resulting death of an entire generation in the wilderness.
    In contrast Moses lived to the age of 120. Since Israel completed their 40
    years in the desert in 1406 BC, Moses was born in 1526 BC. While the exact
    date of his forefather Amram is not known, Scripture says Amram was born in
    Egypt, married a daughter of Levi and his father was apparently an adult,
    so we place his birth shortly after the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn,
    say about 1870 BC. Thus we are measuring from birth to birth rather from
    death to death since these are the firmer numbers. Amram lived 137 years
    and Moses 120 years, so the decrease in longevity was 17 years. The years
    that passed are as follows: 1870 &amp; 1527 or 244 years. The generations
    involved are: 244/25=10. Thus declining longevity was 1.7 years per
    generation in this final measure.
</p>
<p>
    So, Scripture provides four rough measures of lifespans over about 2500
    years. Immediately after the Flood man's lifespan 450 years. Then, 1500
    years later it was 236 years. Five hundred years after that it was down to
    140 and yet 500 years still later it stood at 120. Would anyone question
    that Scripture charts a continual decline of longevity from the Flood to
    the death of Moses 2.5 millennia later. It would seem this gradual decline
    adequately explains the halving between Eber and Peleg. Most definitely God
    had given Abraham's line unusual strength and longevity. Many of the
    biblical numbers are at the high end of human longevity. This is especially
    seen in Levi's line concluding with Moses and his two siblings who all
    reached the age of 120 or more at the point where the average lifespan was
    70. But even working with numbers that are at the high end of longevity
    there was still a clear and continuous decline from the Flood to Moses.
</p>
<h3>
    Two Standards for Starting New Generations
</h3>
<p>
    Knowing the number of missing generations is one of two numbers needed to
    determine the time of the Flood. The years represented by each generation
    must also be known. Then the number of missing generations will be
    multiplied by the years in a generation to determine how many years are
    missing between Eber and Peleg. The years in a generation will also be used
    when the total number of years is known but the number of generations is
    not known as in the case of the Egyptian sojourn.
</p>
<p>
    As the records are studied it is apparent that as longevity decreased, the
    years to adulthood and thus producing offspring also decreased. While one
    might suspect this to be true, the record clearly shows it did happen.
    Those who lived about 900 years started families when they were about 100.
    While this does not help us find any missing generations before the Flood,
    it strongly establishes the concept of declining years to adulthood being a
    function of declining longevity. For our specific task we use 32 years to
    represent adulthood between Arpachshad and Jacob and 20 years in the period
    after Jacob, a total of 12 years decline in reaching adulthood after the
    Flood.
</p>
<h4>
    1. Standard Number One: 32 years
</h4>
<p>
    In the first grouping following the Flood (Arpachshad-Shelah-Eber),
    families began when fathers were 35, 30 and 34 or an average age of 33. In
    the second grouping (Peleg-Reu-Serug-Nahor), families began when the
    fathers were 30, 32, 30 and 29 or an average age of 30.25. To average all
    seven, we sum them (35+30+34+30+32+30+20=220) and divide by seven
    (220/7=31.43). To remain conservative and for sake of ease we rounded this
    number up to 32. Thirty-two then becomes the average number of years in
    each generation missing between Eber and Peleg. By way of example if ten
    generations were missing between Eber and Peleg, 320 years would need to be
    added to the Shem line total to determine the time of the Flood (32 x 10 =
    320).
</p>
<p>
    Following the first seven fathers named above, the next four fathers
    started families very late due to unusual circumstances: Terah at age 70,
    Abraham at age 86, Isaac at age 60 and Jacob at age 82. Each was an
    extraordinary situation. Infertility was the difficulty in the first three
    occasions, each of which involved Terah's line. For some reason he did not
    father Abraham until he was 130. Scripture specifically states that Sarah,
    Abraham's wife and an offspring of Terah, was barren. By divine
    intervention she and Abraham had their first and only son when Abraham was
    100. Abraham's son Isaac was also married to a descendant of Terah and did
    not father an offspring by his wife Rebekah until God answered his prayer
    for offspring twenty years after they were married (Genesis 25:21). By that
    time Isaac was 60.
</p>
<p>
    Jacob's situation is more unusual yet. Since Abraham arranged a marriage
    for Isaac when Isaac was 40, Jacob and his twin brother Esau likely
    expected that their father would arrange a marriage for them when they
    turned 40. Unfortunately, Isaac did not. When Isaac did not act Esau took
    not one but two Canaanite wives. They so distressed his mother that Jacob,
    being sensitive to his mother's feelings, decided to wait. It would be
    another 42 years before Jacob was married and his first child was born.
</p>
<p>
    Determining the beginning of new generations on the basis of Terah,
    Abraham, Isaac and Jacob would miss the average by a country mile. Yet,
    their ages are frequently used as the measure of a generation and this is
    one of the reasons our declining longevity argument has been so well
    hidden. Since they are unusual cases, we will use the standard of 32 years
    derived from Arpachshad through Nahor in determining generations from the
    Flood down to the time of Jacob. In this way Terah being 130 when he begat
    Abraham represents four normal generations while Abraham fathering Isaac at
    the age of 100 represents three typical generations.
</p>
<p>
    In the same way Isaac fathering the twins at the age of 60 represents two
    generations and Jacob beginning his family at the age of 82 represents
    nearly three generations. So while one might protest about a 5-4.5 year
    decline of longevity per generation and point to the 30 year decline
    between Terah and Abraham, that decline must be viewed in terms of four
    generations. This concept is further strengthened when one considers the 25
    year decline from Terah to Isaac. It happened over the equivalent of seven
    generations. When viewed that way, the 5-4.5 year decline is in the ball
    park (25/7 = 3.5 year decline per generation). On the other hand, Abraham
    and Jacob lived more stressful lives than Isaac.
</p>
<p>
    Another confirmation of this general principle is that as longevity
    decreased so did the potential start of each new generation. Eber and Peleg
    started their families at 34 and 30. But those after Jacob started their
    families even before the age of 20. Thus the age for reaching adulthood
    gradually declined to about 20 by the period following Jacob.
</p>
<h4>
    2. Standard Number Two: 25 years
</h4>
<p>
    Above we stated that the age of adulthood after Jacob was around 20. That
    is the record. But in the following discussion we will show that reaching
    adulthood and starting a family did not coincide as it did in the
    generations after the Flood when God's command to repopulate the earth was
    paramount. So we have decided on age 25 for starting new generations in
    this second time span.
</p>
<p>
    Again Scripture provides us with much useful data-in this case, Jacob's
    extended family that accompanied him to Egypt (Genesis 46:8-27). While
    Jacob started his family in his 80's and even his twin brother waited until
    he was 40, Jacob's sons began having families in their twenties and even
    before they were twenty. Case in point: we know the most about Judah's
    fathering in the years before the relocation to Egypt when Judah was 45. In
    those 45 years Judah grew up, married and fathered three sons. Furthermore,
    his three sons grew up, two married and the third reached the age of
    marriage all in the same 45 years. Then Judah committed incest with the
    widow of his second son, thereby starting a third generation family. His
    second group of sons (twins by his daughter-in-law) should have been
    grandsons. This works out to starting the next generation when he was 23
    and the third when he was 45-two generations in 45 years or 22.5 years per
    generation.
</p>
<p>
    Some will protest that this was an unusual circumstance and requires an
    adjustment. Having sons through his daughter-in-law certainly was unusual.
    What should have happened is that when his first son was married at the age
    of 20, that son should have fathered a child instead of spilling his seed
    on the ground so that the LORD slew him. Then these two successive
    generations would have started when the fathers were 23 and 21 or an
    average of 22 years per father.
</p>
<p>
    But that is not all. The second family Judah fathered consisted of
    twins-Zerah and Perez. The twins were born just before or just after the
    move to Egypt. But those named who moved to Egypt include two sons of Perez
    even though they were still in the womb and would not be born for another
    20 or 25 years (Genesis 46:12). If this were not the case, a fourth
    generation would have been added to Judah's line by the time he was 45.
    This would amount to new generations starting when each father was 15 years
    old which is highly unlikely. Since Hebrew genealogies are flexible, the
    writer of this part of Genesis chose to provide a fuller record of Jacob's
    lineage in Egypt, so he included sons still in the womb who would be born
    in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    The record of Benjamin tops them all, further illustrating the idea of sons
    born to a very young father and even including unborn sons in this
    extensive list of Jacob's heirs that accompanied him to Egypt. Benjamin was
    24 when they moved to Egypt in 1876 BC. Genesis 46:21 lists ten sons for
    him! If they were all alive at the time of the move Benjamin would have had
    to have multiple wives and start having sons in his teens. Most likely some
    were grandsons or even great grandsons. Further, several are attributed to
    another of Jacob's sons in another passage, so apparently a scribal error
    contributes to the confusion, but a few must have been alive at the time of
    the move meaning he was in his late teens or early twenties when he started
    his family.
</p>
<p>
    Three sons are listed for Levi (Exodus 6:16) who was 46 at the time of the
    move. Since no sons are listed for Kohath at the time of the move, Kohath's
    son Amram was born after the move to Egypt. Consequently, Kohath could have
    been an adult at the time of the move. Amram married a daughter Levi
    fathered after the move (Numbers 26:59). So unless she was born when Levi
    was elderly, the two male generations, Kohath and Amram, must have been
    born when their fathers were in their mid-twenties.
</p>
<p>
    At the time of the move Jacob's sons ranged from age 48 for Reuben to age
    39 for Joseph plus Benjamin who came along later and was 24. Each of
    Jacob's sons had at least one named son at the time of the move
    demonstrating the vigor of his line. It seems that some of his fifty plus
    grandsons were well beyond infancy. All of this points to the sons of Jacob
    starting families in their teens and twenties.
</p>
<p>
    By the time of the Exodus 430-years later all able-bodied males aged 20-50
    served in Moses' citizen army to defend their infant nation. Presumably, if
    a 20-year-old was considered old enough to risk his life in defense of his
    country, he was also old enough to marry and start a family. So the decline
    of longevity to the age of 70 was accompanied by the decline in reaching
    adulthood at the age of 20. As stated above this would be a 12 year decline
    in reaching maturity.
</p>
<p>
    However, those early generations needed to repopulate the earth so they
    started families as soon as they were able. As we have seen, Jacob's sons
    were commonly starting families by the age of 20. Thus the potential age
    for starting families shrunk from 32 to 20. Nevertheless, for our purposes
    we need averages, not potential. By the time Israel was in Egypt and after,
    even though young men could potentially start families at 20, they had the
    leisure of starting them later and many examples are found of those who
    started families later, even Joseph the step-father of Jesus. As a result
    we suggest using the age of 25 for determining generations during this
    period. Using 25 rather than 20 decreases the number of generations in
    Egypt by 20%.
</p>
<h3>
    Estimates of Omitted Generations and Year of the Flood
</h3>
<p align="center">
    (See also Appendix Table 7.4)
</p>
<p>
    Now we can estimate when the Flood happened, but this estimate is only a
    broad range of years, not a specific year. Following that will be an
    explanation of how these numbers were reached and the many variables. By
    recognizing omitted generations between Eber and Peleg the Flood dates
    between 4300 and 3600 BC. These dates are particularly encouraging to those
    who accept the Bible as divinely inspired because they encompass the
    earliest well-established post-Flood civilizations of mankind revealed by
    overwhelming secular evidence. In fact, Scripture indicates that those who
    got off the Ark quickly established an advanced civilization. Further,
    these numbers provide more years than the LXX which some creationists are
    resorting to.
</p>
<p>
    The maximum date for the Flood is found by recognizing a 225 year decline
    between Eber and Peleg, an average decline of 4.5 years per generation and
    a 200 year quiet period immediately following the Flood to restart life. By
    dividing the total decline (225 years) by the decline per generation (4.5
    years), 50 generations are found to be missing (225/4.5=50). The 200 quiet
    years give another 6.25 generations for a total of 56.25 generations. Since
    generations started every 32 years, by these considerations 1800 years are
    missing between Eber and Peleg (32x56.25=1800).
</p>
<p>
    Before the gap is a period of 101 years-the two years until the birth of
    Arpachshad, the 35 until he fathered Shelah, the 30 until Shelah fathered
    Eber and the 34 until Eber fathered the first unrecorded generation
    (2+35+30+34=101). By including the years until the birth of the first
    unknown generation (101) and the years from the birth of Peleg to Christ
    (2417), the maximum date of the Flood would be 4318 BC or 4300 BC for a
    round number (1800+101+2417=4318).
</p>
<p>
    The minimum date for the Flood is found by assuming that Eber had
    extraordinary vigor and that if he had been average, he would have lived
    five fewer years than his father Shelah. Using 189 years of total decline
    between Eber and Peleg and five years for the average decline sets the
    number of missing generations at 37.8. Assuming also that during the most
    severe part of the Ice Age longevity decreased more rapidly, we round those
    generations down to 35. Multiplying 35 by the exact number of years per
    generation (31.43) calculates to 1100 years missing from the record
    (31.43x35=1100). Adding the years in the gap to those before and after
    gives the minimum time of the Flood as 3618 BC (1100+101+2417=3618).
    Rounding 3618 to the nearest 100 gives a round figure range of 3600-4300
    BC.
</p>
<p>
    A friend saw these estimates of the missing generations between Eber and
    Peleg and took strong exception. He said four calendars from different
    parts of the world (China, India, Europe and the Americas) all point to
about 4000 BC as the beginning of the earth. He said to read    <em>After the Flood</em> by Bill Cooper. Amazingly, Cooper cited three
    calendars that he felt were free of major internal contradictions. All
    three placed creation at 4700 BC or earlier. Of the three he considered the
    Parker Chronicle to be the most reliable. It is Anglo-Saxon and places
    creation at 5200 BC.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> By
    adding the biblical years before the Flood (1656) to our range of Flood
    dates (4300-3600 BC), creation falls in the range of 5956-5256 BC which is
    not that much greater than the Parker Chronicle and our dates come solely
    from studying God's Word.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Calculating Peleg's Year of Birth (See also Appendix Table 7.1)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This paper tags 2417 BC as the year of Peleg's birth. The trail to that
    date begins with Jacob's move to Egypt in 1876 BC, the standard date
    preferred by Evangelicals. When he came to Egypt, Pharaoh asked his age.
    Jacob replied that he was 130 years old (Genesis 47:9). By adding 130 to
    the 1876 BC date, we find Jacob was born in 2006 BC (1876+130=2006). Isaac
    was 60 when Jacob was born (2006+60=2066). Abraham was 100 when Isaac was
    born (2066+100=2166). By adding the numbers for the years of five previous
    fathers (Terah-130; Nahor-29; Serug-30; Reu-32; Peleg-30 = 251), we find
    Peleg was born about 2417 BC (2166 + 251 = 2417).
</p>
<p>
    The year Levi was born is determined as follows. Joseph was elevated at the
    age of 30 (Genesis 41:46). Seven years of plenty and two years of famine
    had passed so Joseph was 39 when Pharaoh asked his father's age and Jacob
    replied that he was 130. Thus Joseph was born when his father was 91
    (130-39=91) which would place Joseph's birth at 1915 BC (2006-91=1915).
    Joseph was the youngest of the eleven sons born to Jacob in Haran in just
    nine years so his oldest brother Reuben would have been born in 1924 BC
    (1915+9=1924) and the third oldest, Levi would have been born in 1922 BC
    (1924-2=1922).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Individuals not fitting the pattern</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Averages must be protected from exceptions and unusual circumstances. Both
    unusually vigorous people and people with lifespans considerably less than
    the average must be treated with care and when justified appropriate
    adjustments must be made. Possibly such a case is Eber, the third
    generation descendant of Shem who lived 464 years which is 31 years longer
    than his father Shelah (433 years). With Eber longevity increased rather
    than decreased. This is contrary to the general trend so he was likely
    unusually vigorous, but just how vigorous? His father and he could be
    treated like Peleg and Reu who both lived to the age of 239 immediately
    after the gap. With that adjustment Eber would be considered as living 433
    years like his father. Or apart from unusual vitality again for sake of
    averages, he could be counted as living five fewer years than his father
    just as his father lived five fewer years than his grandfather. That would
    establish his lifespan at 428 years for the sake of averages and produce a
    longevity decline of 189 years (428-239=189). This would calculate to 38
    missing generations (189/5=38) or 1216 years (32x38=1216) and place the
    Flood at 3734 BC (2517+101+1216=3734 BC). More on Eber later.
</p>
<p>
    Following Serug was Nahor who lived a short 148 years. He does not fit the
    pattern. Maybe he was sickly but more likely he died from violence or in
    some kind of accident. (Similarly, we suspect Lamech died from violence.)
    So his years do not contribute to our search for the average decline per
    generation. But a minor skipping of generations may have occurred between
    Serug and Nahor. In David's line were three groups of three consecutive
    individuals with a relatively equal number of omissions between each group
    of three. If Moses were skipping two groups of names, the second gap would
    fall between Serug and Nahor. However, the decline between Serug and
    Nahor's son is only 25 years. At most 25 years only represents five or six
    generations and such a small number (25 years) is not beyond the deviation
    from averages.
</p>
<p>
    We have already mentioned his son, Terah, who also does not fit the pattern
    already established. While his grandfather Serug lived 230 years, Terah
    lived 205 years, a 25 year decrease over two generations. Further he bore
    his first son at the age of 70 while all the preceding fathers born after
    the Flood fathered their first sons between the ages of 29 and 35. For
    these reasons we feel that the records of Nahor and Terah do not fit the
    clear pattern of the three born before the gap and the three born after the
    gap, so we are not using them in our search for the average years of
    longevity decline after the Flood.
</p>
<p>
    Another exception could be Jacob's years. He describes how Laban exploited
    him for 20 years (Genesis 31:38-42). He was like a slave to Laban. After
    returning to Canaan he appointed Joseph to supervise his older brothers. He
    might have done this because he was worn out by that time. You might say he
    worked himself to death and thus died sooner than he would have otherwise.
    Thus, he most likely died younger than if he had not worked so hard.
</p>
<p>
    An entirely different consideration is the work of God in judging unbelief
    while giving certain leaders and the line of Christ greater years and
    vitality. History records that in the early second millennium BC pharaohs
    were living about 60 years. Yet Joseph lived 110 years and each of those
    first three fathers in the line of Levi lived about 135 years. Even more
    startling four centuries later Mariam, Aaron and Moses all lived 120 years
    or more. Yet Moses wrote in his final days that a full lifetime was 70
    years (Psalm 90:10). Possibly God supernaturally granted more years to
    Moses and his siblings in order to found the nation.
</p>
<p>
    However, the 70 year standard might have been related to the judgment of
    God on the Exodus generation. Because of their unbelief God said they would
    not enter the Promised Land. Hebrews three relates that an entire
    generation other than those who believed God perished in the wilderness. It
    could be that the 70 year standard Moses wrote of took more time to become
    fully established after his death.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk75171914"><strong>Noah and Shem</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    Noah and his son Shem are special cases in a category by themselves. Since
    both were born before the Flood they received the genes that called for 900
    year life spans. As a result, both lived a long time after the Flood-Noah
    350 years and Shem 500 years. There are reasonable explanations for how
    they could live so many years after the Flood when the new normal lifespan
    of those born after the Flood was 450 years. It is common medical knowledge
    that genes given at birth plus those replacements in one's early years have
    the most effect on one's lifespan. Noah was 600 years old when the Flood
    came. His physical body developed for 600 years under pre-Flood conditions.
    Certainly his walk with God gave him extra vitality. Because of all those
    pre-Flood years, the new conditions after the Flood most likely had less
    effect on him. If he had lived his entire lifetime before the Flood,
    perhaps he would have lived over 1000 years and set the record for the
    longest lifespan in human history. He also lived during those first two
    hundred years after the Flood that may have been a quiet time especially
    given by God for the Ark passengers to get on their feet before the Ice Age
    began taking its toll.
</p>
<p>
    While Noah lived 1/3 of his life after the Flood, Shem lived 5/6ths of his
    life after the deluge. He only had 100 years to develop his body before the
    hard times following the Flood. Without the impact of the Flood Shem most
    likely would have lived 900 years like his forefathers. Thus, it must be
    that those 500 years after the Flood had a much greater impact on his body
    than the 350 years his father lived after the Flood had on his father's
    body. As his father's heir, possibly the burdens of leadership and
    especially upholding faith in God after the Flood could well have taken
    their toll on his lifespan.
</p>
<p>
    He may also have chosen to remain in the growing mountains of Ararat where
    the climate was more severe rather than in the Mesopotamian civilization
    bowl where Noah's descendants were defying God at Babel. His life may even
    have been cut short by accident or violence. So while Shem was not given
    those post-Flood genes which would have cut his life to 450 years, his body
    did bear the impact of living under the new conditions far more than it did
    on his father's body. Thus, Noah and Shem must not be cited in the
    averages. To include them is to compare oranges with apples and thus to
    obscure the powerful impact the Flood had on human longevity.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk75171983">
        <strong>Further Considerations on Eber, the Wild Card</strong>
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Eber lived 31 years longer than his father Shelah and 26 years longer than
    his grandfather who was born two years after the Flood. This might indicate
    that longevity actually increased in the third generation or at a minimum
    that there was no overall longevity decrease in the early years after the
    Flood. But again, for some unexplained reason God may have given Eber
    greater vitality. Or, it might have been like this-God may have sent a
    quiet period giving the eight ark survivors and their new families time to
    transition from food supplies on the ark to farming and shepherding. They
    also may have spent years salvaging the building materials used in the
    ark's construction, moving them to a safe location before the Ice Age
    gained momentum. Possibly Eber's father and grandfather in effect worked
    themselves to an early grave as they labored to restart human life after
    the Flood so Eber had it a little easier. Eber could have lived in the
    Mesopotamian basin where the Ice Age had less effect while Shem and sons
    could have stayed in regions closer to the Ararat Mountains which
    experienced more severe weather.
</p>
<p>
    Possibly Eber's 464 years is the true longevity number for those first
    generations after the Flood. So enjoying unusual vitality, having it a
    little easier or not being the victim of sickness, an accident or foul play
    could explain Eber's longer lifespan. Because we do not know why Eber lived
    longer, he is something of a wild card. Just how one sees Eber's longer
    lifespan will affect his view of the number of years missing between Eber
    and Peleg. This uncertainty and the many exceptions previously noted
    require humility in approaching our subject and remind us again that God
    has only chosen to give us a general idea of the time of the Flood and not
    a more exact time.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, we must recognize that the entire period from Eber to Moses was
    one of continuous, gradual declining longevity, but it would seem that the
    decline would not be a straight line. Rather it would be faster or slower
    depending on the level of stress and the location of the individual.
    Stressful conditions such as living in the teeth of the Ice Age or living
    as a slave would certainly reduce longevity faster. Yet even as some bore
    the rigors of the Ice Age the far greater population lived in the more
    agreeable climates of Southern Mesopotamia and Arabia. Maybe warfare and
    violence did as much to decrease their longevity as natural conditions.
    Nevertheless, the amount of generational decline most likely varied from
    region to region and from period to period. Our records come mostly from
    just one family line so they reflect the region and the period of that
    line's experiences.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="_Hlk75448735"><strong>Shem's List - Not a Chronology</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
    This chapter has presented strong evidence that Shem's genealogy in Genesis
    11:10-26 is not a chronology. But those begetting numbers have great value
    as they reveal that the Flood marked both an immediate and long term
    decline in human longevity. Further, they disclose the vast difference
    between pre-Flood and post-Flood conditions. Most importantly, they show
    the effects of sin.
</p>
<p>
    It was easy to conclude Shem's list was a chronology because the begetting
    age of each father is given, ten consecutive fathers with eight consecutive
    begetting numbers. But like a red flag Scripture does not add those numbers
    even though it gives important chronological totals elsewhere such as the
    430-years in Egypt (Exodus 12:40) and the 480 years from the Exodus to the
    Temple (I Kings 6:1). In fact it neither invites the reader to add those
    numbers nor even gives a single hint that those numbers should be
    considered a chronology. While the silence of Scripture does not close the
    issue, it is a strong witness against the chronology argument.
</p>
<p>
    But Shem's list does give an obvious clue that its objective was something
    other than a chronology. It's ten names are matched by ten names in Adam's
    list. Symmetry, not chronology appears to be the goal of placing ten names
    in each list. Ten representative names from Adam to Noah and ten more from
    Shem to Abraham beginning the line to the Redeemer first promised in
    Genesis 3:15.
</p>
<p>
    Viewing Shem's list as a chronology is an interpretation, not a fact.
    Interpretations of Scripture and facts of Scripture must be carefully
    distinguished. The Gospel is a fact. That Jesus is the predicted Messiah of
    the OT is a fact. That Shem's list is a chronology doesn't qualify as a
    fact. A special branch of bibliology is called hermeneutics, the science of
    how to interpret Scripture. The most basic rule of hermeneutics is to
    compare Scripture with Scripture. This is the rite of passage that
    determines how the particular author of a passage meant his words to be
    understood.
</p>
<p>
    How did the author of Shem's list use those words? The answer lies in how
    other Scriptures use genealogical concepts. Eventually it becomes apparent
    that they were about relating fathers to sons and sons to fathers, not
    giving exhaustive and complete lists. In effect they were used as this book
    finds in these first 100 plus pages. Identity was the issue, not history.
    Ultimately, Adam's line comes to a specific person named Noah and Noah's
    line comes to a specific person named Abraham whose descendants God will
    use to form the nation Israel and send the Savior. While it may be
    embarrassing or humiliating, those holding the chronological view must
    teach their followings the true way to view Shem's list.
</p>
<h3>
    Records Illustrating the Decline in Human Longevity
</h3>
<p>
    The information we have covered is summarized below in outline form. It
    shows the grouping of consecutive fathers for the purpose of establishing
    averages to illustrate declining lifespans of people born after the Flood.
    These numbers are taken directly from the Scriptures and therefore are as
    certain as Scripture itself. The groupings provide averages for each of the
    four periods identified in Scripture. Appendices Tables 7.1 - 7.4 give the
    details together with the summary in a numbers format.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lifespans in Period #1: 450 years (Arpachshad-Eber)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        (First Three Consecutive Fathers Born After the Flood) (about 4000 BC)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
Arpachshad (438 years) - Shelah (433 years):    <strong>5 year decline per generation</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Shelah (433 years) - Eber (464 years): <strong>31 year increase</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Generational Decline (omitting Eber): 5 years
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lifespans in Period #2: 236 years (Peleg-Reu)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        (First Three Consecutive Fathers Born After the Gap) (about 2400 BC)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Peleg (239) - Reu (239): <strong>0 year decline</strong>
</p>
<p>
Reu (239) - Serug (230):    <strong>9 year decline over two generations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Average Decline per Generation from Peleg to Serug: 4.5 years
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lifespans in Period #3: 137 years (Jacob-Amram)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        (Four Consecutive Fathers Born About the Time Israel Moved to Egypt)
        (1876 BC)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jacob (147) - Levi (137): <strong>10 year decline </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (Jacob=2.8 generations: first son born at age 82)
</p>
<p>
    Levi (137) - Kohath (133): <strong>4 year decline</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Kohath (133) - Amram (137): <strong>4 year increase</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Average Adjusted Decline per Generation: <strong>2.1 years</strong>
    (10/4.8=2.1)
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Lifespans in Period #4: about 90 Years (Joseph-Psalm 90:10)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>(Birth of Amram to Birth of Moses; c. 1866 BC- 1522 BC)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Years in period: 1866-1522=344 years
</p>
<p>
    Decline per generation: 2.8 years/generation (395/28=14.1; 40/14.1=2.835)
</p>
<p>
    After the Exodus in 1446 BC Israel wandered in the wilderness for 40 years
    as an entire generation perished by divine judgment. But the judgment was
    not the shortening of lifetimes. It was the sentence to stay in the
    wilderness until an entire generation perished. By the end of that time
    Moses observed that the normal full lifetime of man was 70 years. Joseph
    died at 110 early in the Egyptian sojourn. It seems that these 40 years of
    decline (110-70=40) occurred over about 400 years, from 1800 to 1400 BC.
    That amounts to a decline of approximately 2.8 years per generation, but it
    was a decline under the great stresses of slavery and the wilderness
    wandering.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Inescapable Conclusion</strong>
    : The data above shows that the lifespans in each period were shorter than
    those in the previous period. No one who accepts the inerrancy of Scripture
    would dispute this. Thus, beyond question Scripture itself reveals a
    continuing decline of lifespan from the time the Ark survivors left the Ark
    until the day of Moses nearly three millennia later. This progressive
    decline is undeniable.
</p>
<p>
    But the biblical numbers also reveal a second halving of human longevity,
    the halving between Eber and Peleg. Scripture records a 225 year difference
    in the lifespans of Eber and Peleg. A difference of 25 or even 50 years
    might be acceptable but a halving, from 450 years for the first three
    generations after the Flood to 236 years for the next three generations
    after the Flood is a red flag. Something happened between Eber and Peleg.
    That happening was the author of the passage employing the common Hebrew
    solution to long lists, he used YLD "to father" in the broad sense rather
    than the usual narrow sense of immediate relationship. While following his
    pattern of reporting when each father produced a son, that number refers to
    the immediate unnamed son while "to father" is used in the broad sense of a
    distant descendant.
</p>
<p>
    So, it took the most severe act of nature in human history, the Flood, to
    cut man's longevity from 900 to 450 years. Nowhere do we read of a similar
    act of nature to cut man's lifespan in half a second time. Thus, this
    second line of argument strengthens the conclusion that this huge span of
    225 years was not over a single generation; rather, it was the sum of
    declines of many generations skipped between Eber and Peleg. Missing
    generations explains the second halving of human longevity.
</p>
<h3>
    Genesis 5 - Omissions in the Line of Adam
</h3>
<p>
    <sup>6</sup>
    When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. <sup>7</sup>Seth lived
after he fathered Enosh 807 years and had other sons and daughters.    <sup>8</sup>Thus all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died. Genesis
    5:6-8.
</p>
<p>
    Genesis five records Adam's genealogy, ten names from Adam to Noah. While
    it is not the subject of this book, it is often discussed along with Shem's
    list, so we must add a word about it. If Shem's line in Genesis 11 is
    explicit, Adam's line here in Genesis 5 is more so. While Shem's line gives
    five details including the years before and after the birth of the son,
    Adam's list gives those details and totals the years of the father as well.
    Why that sixth detail? Merely to establish a pattern? More likely, because
    of the great ages involved, the writer felt that he needed to total the
    years to avoid any misunderstanding.
</p>
<p>
    As in Shem's line, each of the details in Adam's line is literal. Each
    named person was a real person. He actually lived all the years the passage
    says and he fathered a son. Some see in this list the abbreviation of many
    millennia. One is the well-known covenant scholar, Meredith Kline who
    taught that this Adam list represented more human history than the entire
    time since the Flood<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>. He
    observed that the list contains ten names which raises the suspicion that
    it is tailored. But his reason for this vast amount of time is that he
    views history in terms of divine covenants and according to him Peter
    divides history into the world that was, which perished by water, and the
    world that now is, which will perish by fire, as stated in II Peter 3:5-7.
</p>
<p>
    One of his students, Michael Lawrence, showed this author the printed notes
    from Dr. Kline's class on covenant theology at Gordon-Conwell Theological
    Seminary. Lawrence had previously earned a bachelor degree at Duke
    University and following Gordon, continued his education with a Ph.D. in
    church history at Cambridge University, often regarded as one of the most
    prestigious universities in the world. While he did not agree with Kline's
    idea of so many years before the Flood, he did give insight into why
    Archbishop James Ussher felt the lines of Adam and Shem were tight,
    exhaustive, immediate father-son relationships.
</p>
<p>
    Lawrence explained that Ussher was a Bible scholar who loved the Word of
    God and believed in inerrancy. But he was bound by the rigid thinking
    concerning genealogies in Great Britain which viewed them as precise, exact
    and complete. England and Scotland had a combined monarchy. When Queen
    Elizabeth died childless a careful examination of genealogies determined
    that James VI of Scotland was the correct successor and he became King
    James I of England-Scotland. This selection required careful records for
    officials to determine who had the next claim to the throne. Precise
    genealogical records gave the answer. To Ussher it was inconceivable that
    genealogies could be taken in any other way.
</p>
<p>
    This was the only way someone living in England-Scotland would ever take
    genealogies. Ussher was a product of his culture and brought to the
    Scripture his cultural experience just as all Christians bring to the
    Scripture a framework of assumptions. In this way he made unfounded
    assumptions about the Biblical genealogies. To him genealogies were all
about a line of succession.    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>
    While condensation is all but demanded by the enormous drop in longevity
    between Eber and Peleg, no such clue is found in the Adam line. Instead, we
    find a growing pattern of sin. "The wickedness of man was great in the
    earth and...every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil
    continually" (Genesis 6:5). Conversely, Enoch walked with the LORD and
    became the first of four successive, unbroken generations-Enoch,
    Methuselah, Lamech and Noah-so it was exactly 969 years from the birth of
    his son Methuselah to the Flood. Further, Seth was the immediate son of
    Adam. Only four fathers remain who might have represented thousands of
    omitted years-Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel and Jared.
</p>
<p>
    Man's growing sinfulness brought on the Flood. We suggest God's justice
    required Him to terminate generations born into this irreversible
    situation. To stop this pattern God limited the number of generations
    before the Flood. Kline failed to grasp the purpose of the Flood-to break
    the enslaving straight jacket of sin and restart the human race. While
    Adam's line does not represent millennia of human history, a few names
    might have been omitted to produce precisely ten. Even if two or three were
    omitted, this would add only 200-300 years to the age of the earth. Kline's
    call for a long pre-flood era of many millennia is merely another example
    of how we all wonder much about the years before the Flood. We take our
    various stabs at them. Yet, they lie not in numbers as much as in
    understanding the mysteries of iniquity and godliness (II Thessalonians 2
    and I Corinthians 15: 51-58.) Nevertheless, genealogies are a joy, when
    correctly understood, to keep us true to inerrancy and prevent presumption
    in our interpretations of Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    One minor discrepancy in our point that all eight who lived and died before
    the Flood lived about 900 years is Lamech who died at the age of 777. The
    next greatest deviation from the 900 year average is Methuselah who lived
    to 969. Methuselah died the year of the Flood, but his son (Lamech) died
    five years before the Flood. Very possibly Lamech was the victim of foul
    play as attempts grew to silence Noah and his message of judgment. Yet even
this foul play served the purposes of God for it fell on the 777    <sup>th</sup> year of Lamech's life which in numerology has extreme
    significance. Seven represents completion and triple sevens would reflect
    the trinity in seeing this total rejection of the Creator. In Book 2 of
    creation geologist John Reed's fictional Flood trilogy the Godly who had
    helped build the Ark intended to board the Ark but the enemy murdered their
    entire community.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> Only the
    eight escaped.
</p>
<h4>
    What Abbreviated Genealogies Teach
</h4>
<p>
    To summarize, a faulty view of biblical genealogies leads to the idea that
    the time of the Flood and the creation of man can be calculated within a
    few years. This chapter has explained why Hebrew genealogies do not support
    such calculations. It finds overwhelming support that as many as 1300-1900
    years elapsed between Eber and Peleg and maybe 200-300 additional years
    before the Flood. This means that whereas many creationists thought that
    man and living things were created about 6000 years ago, they really were
    created more like 8000 years ago. Thus, we have good reason to be tentative
    where God is silent. But whether 6000 or 8000 or even 10,000 years old,
    lifeforms on planet earth are still vastly young compared to the billion
    year figure of secular science.
</p>
<p>
    So, this book joins those who find overwhelming biblical and scientific
    support for life on earth being but thousands of years old. However, we
    take exception with those who insist that Genesis chapter eleven presents a
    complete father-son list allowing a more exact age calculation. Just one
    clear abbreviated genealogy would question the idea that Shem's genealogy
    is complete. This paper presented such an exception in chapter one, the
    Levi-Aaron list. Chapter six provided many lists where abbreviation is
    certain or suspected. We must conclude that it was not God's will for man
    to be burdened with establishing and defending the age of the earth to
    within a few years. Such an approach is not helpful. It produces divisions
    within and justified criticism without, all of which harm the Kingdom of
    God.
</p>
<p>
    The next chapter tackles maybe the greatest disinformation to Shem's
    genealogy, that found in the Septuagint.
