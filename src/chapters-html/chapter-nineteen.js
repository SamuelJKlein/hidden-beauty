    Chapter Nineteen - Conclusion
</p>
<p>
    Seventeen chapters on biblical genealogies with an additional chapter of
    confirming secular history? Yes, but Scripture warns us to be careful with
    them. Chapter one observed the Apostle Paul's directive to Timothy:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>3</sup>
        As I urged you when I went to Macedonia, remain in Ephesus so that you
        may instruct certain people not to teach false doctrine <sup>4</sup>or
        to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These promote empty
speculations rather than God's plan, which operates by faith.        <sup>5</sup>Now the goal of our instruction is love that comes from a
        pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. <sup>6</sup>Some
have departed from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion.        <sup>7</sup>They want to be teachers of the law, although they don't
        understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on. 1
        Timothy 1:3-7 (CSB).
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In a word genealogies can be harmful. They can even be used to teach false
    doctrine. They can go on and on, advance myths and promote speculation as
    opposed to God's plan. In contrast, this book has restricted itself to what
    Scripture discloses of them. It has functioned under the principle Paul
    would later write Timothy that "All Scripture is God-breathed and
    profitable" (II Timothy 3:16). The revelation God has given concerning
    genealogies cannot be harmful; only its distortions can be.
</p>
<p>
    We began with the genealogy of Aaron listing four names to cover four
    centuries. Obviously, names were skipped. Some therefore conclude Israel
    didn't sojourn in Egypt for four centuries. Chapter two acknowledged that
    not just Moses, but God and Stephen also testified to four centuries in
    Egypt. When Joseph invited his father to move to Egypt to survive the
    famine, Jacob paused before departing the land of promise. God spoke to
    him, repeating the promises He gave to Abraham and Isaac one last time. God
    stated specifically that it would be in Egypt that Jacob's descendants
    would increase to the numbers that comprise a nation. Thus, he was not to
    fear moving to Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Paul spoke of 430-years from the promise to the law. Since Paul would not
    contradict God (Genesis 15:13), his words must be interpreted to mean
    Israel would sojourn in Egypt 430-years following those many times God gave
    the promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and concluding when He gave the
    law at Mount Sinai. Thus, Paul's words also support four centuries in
    Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Others reply, "What about Abraham's call? Doesn't the order of the text
    suggest it came in Haran, not Ur? They conclude, "Those 430-years began
    with God's call to Abraham in Haran and ended with the Exodus." Chapters
    three and four corrected this, showing conclusively that Abraham's calling
    from God came to him at Ur of the Chaldees in southern Mesopotamia, not in
    Haran. As to the order of the text, Scripture finishes the Terah section in
    Genesis 11 before beginning the Abraham section in chapter 12. In addition,
    numerous other misinterpretations in the accounts of Abraham and Jacob used
    to support the 215-year error are corrected.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter five is the heart of this book. It explored many of the over 300
    instances in the Old Testament where filial terms are used in a broad
    sense. While "son" and "father" normally refer to an immediate
    relationship, Hebrew writers often used them in the sense of someone
    further down or up the line. When filial terms were used this way in a
    genealogy, that list would be incomplete. Chapter six presented 15 examples
    of genealogies that skip generations by using filial terms in a broad
    sense.
</p>
<p>
    Creation is the primary evidence for the existence of God. About two
    centuries ago the idea of evolution arose. Evolution's explanation for the
    existence of all things is time, not God. According to evolution billions
    of years brought about the material universe. The Bible indicates God
    created the universe and man thousands, not billions of years ago.
    Creationists reject the idea of vast eons of time. But some have added the
    years in the genealogies of Shem and Adam to give specific dates for the
    Flood and Creation. If those lists are incomplete, their dates are wrong
    and they discredit creation science.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter seven addresses Shem's list and shows that it skips 35-55
    generations, pushing the date of the Flood back many years. This finding is
    consistent with the thinking of most Old Testament inerrancy scholars that
    Shem's list is incomplete. The approximate year of the Flood dogmatically
    declared by certain fellow believers who insist that Shem's list is
    complete is beyond doubt too late. Nowhere in Scripture is the date for the
    Flood given or even hinted at. This book concludes that at best Shem's
    genealogy only provides a range of years in which the Flood occurred. Those
    who date the Flood by adding the numbers in Shem's list provide an easy
    target for dismissing all who appeal to the Bible as authoritative.
</p>
<p>
    The purpose of most biblical genealogies is to relate descendants to
    forefathers and forefathers to descendants without the necessity of naming
    every person in the genealogical line. When this purpose is understood,
    conflicts between the words of Scripture and the numbers found in the
    genealogies are avoided. Thus, a true understanding of the genealogies
    glorifies God as we handle His Word. That has been the goal of this book.
    It has found that beyond question Hebrew genealogies do not always consist
    of immediate father-son dependencies. This understanding frees us from
    wresting other passages of Scriptures in an effort to date the earth to an
exact number of years as did Archbishop James Ussher in    <em>Annals of the World</em>. Yet, neither do we accept evolution's
    billions-of-years view.
</p>
<p>
    Paul's words about genealogies come at the beginning of his letter to
    Timothy. He will speak on many subjects before he is done but this message
    was uppermost in his mind. He states his motive for bringing up the
    subject: "The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a
    good conscience and a sincere faith" (I Timothy 1:5). Paul loved the new
    Ephesian converts as he loved all converts. He didn't want to see their
    Christian lives bound by false Bible teaching. His motive was pure, his
    conscience unviolated, his faith intact.
</p>
<p>
    But according to Paul those who taught on genealogies had a different
    motive. It was not a careful investigation to see what the Old Testament
    actually taught. Their goal was to so teach genealogies that gentiles would
    embrace that law of Moses and in effect become Jewish proselytes. Paul said
    they did not understand what they were talking about (1:7). Ephesians
    chapters two and three shows that gentiles came to Christ apart from the
    law. Paul did not identify those who incorrectly taught genealogies. He
    simply refers to them as "Certain persons" (1:6). Timothy would know who
    Paul was referring to.
</p>
<p>
    Fast forward to today. Certain persons teach that the Bible reveals the
    dates of the Flood and Creation. They say those dates are revealed in the
    genealogies of Shem (Genesis 11) and Adam (Genesis 5). They say that adding
    the numbers in Shem's list discloses the date of the Flood and continuing
    by adding the numbers in Adam's list discloses the date of Creation. But
    those dates are not found specifically in Scripture and it would seem that
    such important dates would be clearly stated if God wanted them known. So
    instead of appealing to the clear statements of Scripture, these certain
    brethren appeal to genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    But what is their motive? The motive of those Paul wrote Timothy about was
    no secret. It was to force gentiles to accept the entire Mosaic Law. One of
    their tools was an erroneous teaching of genealogies. Now for the critical
    question: what is the motive of those who appeal to genealogies today? If
    it is to learn what the Bible teaches about genealogies as this book
    attempts to do, that would be a good motive. If their motive is to study
    those early Hebrew genealogies, they would address them at length, but they
    don't. Rather, their motive is something else. It is an attempt to declare
    those elusive dates.
</p>
<p>
    Challenge to the reader: study the arguments of this book. Are they sound?
    Do they make sense? Are they correct? If you have come to believe so, you
    will become a part of history, helping to correct a biblical error that has
    persisted in the church for two thousand years. What will you accomplish?
    Unbelievers will not be impressed with your new view that maybe the earth
    is 2000 years older than Bible students previously thought. But the global
    Flood depositing the many sedimentary layers on the surface of the earth
    about 3600 to 4300 BC will impress some. Much evidence supports such a
    range of dates. It will be hard to refute. This will result in some
    unbelievers having a higher regard for the Bible and will also support the
    work of creation scientists. For believers, it will further confirm that
    the Bible is true history.
</p>
<p>
    So much of the Bible includes genealogies that we would be amiss in not
    understanding the Holy Spirit's true purpose for them. Rightly understood
    they are a blessing and have been a great blessing to the author. Hopefully
    these truths will likewise inform your faith and make it stronger.
</p>
<p>
    In our zeal for the inerrancy of the Scriptures, we learned more about the
    dear souls God included in His word along with their exploits and failures.
    We gained new insights into relationships and their consequences. People
    and their relationships are important to God-even our names-even our
    organization-what we do for Him and how we do it. In the end our biggest
    concern is what the hymn writer said:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>Lord, I care not for riches, neither silver nor gold,</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>I would make sure of Heaven, I would enter the fold.</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>In the book of Thy kingdom with its pages so fair</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <em>Tell me, Jesus my Savior, Is my name written there?</em>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Is my name written there?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>On the page white and fair?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>In the book of Thy kingdom,</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Is my name written there?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Therefore, as we leave this subject of Hebrew genealogies with over 160,000
    words, we hope no one will still be asking what difference 2000 years of
    human history makes anyway and, really, what's the big deal?
</p>
<p>
    To them we answer, after all, what difference does correct Bible teaching
    make anyway? It makes a huge difference. There is a grave penalty for
    teaching the Word of God incorrectly. James 3:1 gives this sober warning:
    "Be not many of you teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive
    the heavier judgment." Clearly God does not take incorrect Bible teaching
    lightly and if He does not, neither should we.
