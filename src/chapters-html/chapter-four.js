<h1>
    Jacob's Life Requires a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn
</h1>
<p>
    The record of Jacob's life is a moving account of divine intervention and
    growing faith. It also supports a 430-year Egyptian sojourn. To make it
    read otherwise those who elevate numbers over words reinterpret events in
    his life to make them support their 215-year, no-abbreviated-genealogies
    view. In order to see that his life does support 430-years, a careful,
    in-depth look at the events in his life after the pattern of chapter three
    is necessary.
</p>
<p>
    When Jacob's father turned 40, Abraham secured a bride for him (Genesis
    25:21). After twenty years of barrenness Isaac prayed for her and God
    granted his prayer. Miraculously, she became pregnant with twins. As the
    babies developed a strange thing began to happen. She sensed a struggling
    in her womb. She inquired of the LORD and He said:
</p>
<p>
    Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you shall be
    divided; the one shall be stronger than the other, the older shall serve
    the younger. Genesis 25:23.
</p>
<p>
    The struggle in Rebekah's womb foretold the future of the twins and their
    descendants. There would be strife, not harmony. There would be two
    separate nations pursuing their own interests, not family working toward a
    common goal. The older would dominate for a time but eventually the younger
    would prevail. Rebekah did not learn this from a soothsayer or even second
    hand from a prophet of God. No less than God Himself gave this information
    to her directly in answer to her prayer.
</p>
<p>
    As to their actual births, of Esau Scripture records "The first came out
    red, all his body like a hairy cloak." Of Jacob, Scripture continues,
    "afterward his brother came out with his hand holding Esau's heel" (Genesis
    25:26). The midwives must have been dismayed when the second of the twins
    immediately followed with his hand holding the heel of the first. Next,
    Scripture gives a snapshot of the direction the boys' lives took:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        When the boys grew up, Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field,
        while Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents. Genesis 25:27.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the above verse Scripture immediately advances from their birth to the
    two as grown men, reporting that the twins grew up to be very different.
    Hunting characterized the one, the quiet of home the other. Of Jacob Unger
    writes "Jacob preferred the quiet of a home life to the active dangerous
    career of a hunter."<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> So
    Scripture is extremely brief about their early years. Just the struggling
    in the womb, God's personal explanation and what characterized their adult
    years. How different is the story of their father Isaac and all Scripture
    told of his conception, birth, youth and adult years before marrying at the
    age of 40.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture does not elaborate on what it meant to be a skillful hunter or a
    quiet man living in tents. It only hints at these two pursuits by saying
    "Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his game, but Rebekah loved Jacob"
    (Genesis 25:28). Esau wasn't just the average hunter; he was "skillful." He
    greatly enhanced the family table with his game. Because of this he was
    number one in his father's books. Rebekah's greater concern was the
    family's livelihood. Because Jacob focused on learning and operating the
    family ranching business, he became number one in her books. While Esau
    loved to feel the adrenaline of the hunt, Jacob accepted the discipline of
    repetitive daily chores. That daily routine tied him down to a predictable
    schedule. These two men couldn't have been more different.
</p>
<h3>
    Purchasing the Birthright
</h3>
<p>
    After explaining the direction of each twin's life, Scripture discloses
    just one event in their adult lives before Esau married at the age of 40.
    One day Esau returned home from the hunt. Apparently he had pressed and
    pressed without success to the point of exhaustion. He asked Jacob for a
    bowl of his stew. This indicates that the quiet man was there at his
    typical station, doing something useful to sustain the family, this time
    cooking. Here is what happened:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>31</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        Jacob said, "Sell me your birthright now." <sup>32</sup>Esau said, "I
        am about to die; of what use is a birthright to me?" <sup>33</sup>Jacob
        said, "Swear to me now." So he swore to him and sold his birthright to
        Jacob. <sup>34b</sup>Thus Esau despised his birthright. Genesis
        25:31-33, 34b.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Birthright? Where did this come from? How could Jacob suggest such a thing?
    While Scripture gives commentaries on Esau's action, it does not explore
    the background of this event. It assumes the reader would know all that was
    involved, that grandfather Abraham died when the twins were 15 years old
    and would have told them again and again about God's appearances to him and
    the promises those appearances conveyed. Isaac also had similar personal
    experiences with God and had witnessed God's visitations to his father
    Abraham as well. These stories were also told over and over in family
    gatherings. While Rebekah may have kept secret God's words to her before
    the birth of the twins, they must have been aware of at least some of the
    details of their births and why they were given such unusual names.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, while Scripture does not elaborate, it only seems reasonable that
    over the years Jacob and Esau wondered about those stories. Though God's
    visitations to his father and grandfather seemed remote, so beyond anything
    actually happening in their lives, if there was something to them, Jacob
    wanted to be their recipient. Eventually Jacob came to place a measure of
    faith in them and decided to watch for an opportunity to gain the
    birthright. Then suddenly the opportunity came. Esau was famished and
    wanted something Jacob had. Jacob made the offer and maybe to his amazement
    the possessor of the birthright agreed saying "I am about to die; of what
    use is a birthright to me?" (Genesis 25:31).
</p>
<p>
    Just what was the birthright at this time? It is worth hearing from a
    leading Hebrew commentator:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The birthright consisted afterward in a double portion of the father's
        inheritance (Deuteronomy 21:17); but with the Patriarchs it embraced
        the chieftainship, rule over the brethren and the entire family
        (Genesis 27:29) and the title to the blessing of promise (Genesis 27:4,
        27-29), which included the future possession of Canaan and of covenant
        fellowship with Jehovah (Genesis 28:4).
    </strong>
    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Possessing this birthright conveying all God promised to Abraham and Isaac;
    it was the deed to these promises, but it required faith in the true God.
    Scripture pronounces harsh judgment on Esau's act. This passage says he
    despised his birthright. Hebrews calls him unholy because of selling his
    birthright for a mere meal (Hebrews 12:16). Malachi 1:3 gives an overall
    divine assessment: "I have loved Jacob, but Esau, I have hated" (Malachi
    1:3). Henry Morris concurs in these assessments:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        It is remarkable that so many Christians are quick to defend Esau and
        rebuke Jacob [trading a meal for the birthright], when God has done
        neither. Esau was a profane fornicator, with no redeeming qualities
        whatsoever, caring nothing about the spiritual significance and
        responsibilities of the patriarchal birthright, until he thought that
        its loss might diminish his inherited wealth.
    </strong>
    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>
    <strong> (Our words in brackets.)</strong>
</p>
<p>
    After the birthright incident nothing more is said of the boys until the
    end of the next chapter of Genesis. There Scripture reports Esau got
    married. By way of background, when Isaac turned forty, Abraham found him a
    bride-Rebekah, a granddaughter of Abraham's older brother Nahor. Now Esau
    was 40, yet his father gave no indication of finding him and Jacob mates.
    Possibly Esau became convinced his father would do nothing so according to
    the following verse, before the year was out, the man of action, Esau,
    married not one but two Canaanite women:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>34</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        When Esau was forty years old, he took Judith the daughter of Beeri the
        Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite, <sup>35</sup>
        and they made life bitter for Isaac and Rebekah. Genesis 26:34-35.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This action brought Canaanite life with all its evil right into Isaac's
    household. The two Canaanite women made life bitter for both Rebekah and
    Isaac. Jacob, seeing their distress, decided to wait for the right woman.
    That wait lasted forty more years. This second report of Esau's actions
    conclude how Scripture would have us view Esau at this point in his life,
    confirming the characterizations of Genesis 25:34, Hebrews 12:16 and
    Malachi 1:3.
</p>
<p>
    The next glimpse of the twins is even more distressing and not without
    controversy. When Isaac thought he was dying, he determined to pass on the
    blessing of the firstborn to Esau, the twin born first. In view of the
    words of God to Rebekah and the direction of Esau's life, Isaac's plan is
    unexplainable. Without question he was badly confused. But we know what
    happened. Rebekah learned of the plan. She dressed Jacob to impersonate
    Esau and Isaac unintentionally gave the blessing to Jacob.
</p>
<p>
    Esau was angry and let it be known that he would kill his brother once his
    father died. At that point he would add murder to his list of evils. Jacob
    didn't doubt his older brother's word and feared for his life. But sanity
    prevailed. Rebekah discussed the situation with Isaac who blessed Jacob and
    sent him away to the household of his mother's father in Haran. He must
    take a wife from his mother's people. He must not marry a Canaanite woman.
    Trusting God he departed on the 500-mile journey with only a staff in his
    hand. In this way God preserved the Abrahamic line from the abominations of
    the Canaanites.
</p>
<p>
    Only a few nights from home 74-year old Jacob had a dream. In it he saw the
    angels of God rushing up and down on a grand staircase as they carried out
    God's work on earth. At the top was God Himself. He spoke to Jacob, saying
    He was the God of Abraham and Isaac, that He would give this land to Jacob
    and his offspring, that his offspring would be like the dust of the earth,
    that in Jacob and his offspring all the families of the earth would be
    blessed, that He would keep Jacob and return him to this land (Genesis
    28:10-15).
</p>
<p>
    Nothing more is said of the journey but no sooner had Jacob reached his
    destination than he was taken with Rachel who was "beautiful in form and
    appearance" (Genesis 29:17). Rachel was the daughter of his mother's
    brother. Since her older sister, Leah, was becoming something of an old
    maid, Rachel might have been considerably older than a teenager. Jacob
    offered to serve seven years for her hand in marriage and Laban agreed to
    the offer.
</p>
<h2>
    A Closer Look at Jacob
</h2>
<p>
    Jacob has received much criticism for the actions of his youth. But are
    they consistent with God's revelation? What do we learn from Scripture?
    First, Jacob's character. Dr. Morris was distressed to find most
    commentators characterized Jacob as a crooked man, a heel grabber. While it
    cannot be denied he was shrewd, even crafty, he had fine qualities that
    need to be laid beside his stealth. Per chance they mitigate and even cast
    a different light on the broad judgment that he was basically dishonest.
    After all, Rahab told a direct lie but no commentator casts her in the
    light of being a liar. David committed adultery but no commentator
    characterizes him as basically immoral. Other qualities far outshine
    Rahab's lie and David's adultery. As for Jacob, he was professional,
    productive, hard-working, likable and God was with him.
</p>
<p>
    Was he basically dishonest? It was his mother who all but ordered him to
    impersonate Esau. She had great influence on him. He had even foregone
    marriage out of his respect for his parents' feelings and judgment. His
    father was apparently about to disregard God's will and his mother proposed
    a way to avoid that. As to her plan, it certainly was dishonest, but the
    tendency toward dishonesty came mostly from her side of the family. Her
    brother was as crooked as they come. He changed Jacob's wages countless
    times to steal what rightly belonged to Jacob. He gave Jacob Leah after
    Jacob had served him seven years for Rachel. So let's dispense with
    labeling Jacob "dishonest." Instead see him as Scripture begins to speak
    much of him, beginning with his arrival in the region of Haran.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Now as soon as Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's
        brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near
        and rolled the stone from the well's mouth and watered the flock of
        Laban his mother's brother. Genesis 29:10.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Notice Jacob's skill with animals. Although he was a complete stranger to
    this flock, Rachel's sheep immediately sensed they were in good hands,
    allowing him to water them. Jacob also understood the sheep business for he
    had previously noted to the other shepherds that it was high noon and the
    sheep needed to be grazing, not waiting to be watered. Then, without help,
    he removed the cover from the well and watered Rachel's sheep. He was not
    bound by incompetent practices which limited the success of shepherding in
    that area. This act displayed initiative, independence, strength,
    confidence and competence.
</p>
<p>
    If Jacob acted with professionalism towards this newly encountered flock,
    his next action showed a soul filled with deep emotion and expectation. His
    skill with the sheep was only exceeded by his way with the shepherdess.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>11</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <sup>12</sup>And Jacob told
        Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and he was Rebekah's son, and
        she ran and told her father. Genesis 29:11-12.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The kiss: Maybe tender and on the cheek, but arising from deep emotion.
    This 74-year-old man bawled aloud. Just as Abraham's servant had found his
    mother immediately upon his arrival 94 years before, Jacob no more arrived
    than he stumbled on what he must have hoped would be his life's partner.
    Both events happened somewhere near Haran. She was the right fit-his
    mother's niece, his own cousin whom he had never met and probably did not
    know existed, beautiful, enterprising, engaging and receiving. What a
    reward after forsaking his home of 74 years and making a perilous, lonely,
    500-mile journey. The girl's father invited Jacob to stay with them.
</p>
<p>
    The next verses tell us Jacob was smart and industrious. Rather than
    spending all of his time with Rachel, he immediately set out to impress her
    father with his work ethic and he succeeded. A month later Laban
    uncharacteristically began the following conversation:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing?
        Tell me, what shall your wages be? Genesis 29:15.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Wages? Here was Jacob's opportunity. Jacob wanted Rachel. He had no money
    for a dowry but he could work. He made an offer of service for this
    daughter of Laban. He would serve Laban seven years for Rachel and then she
    would be his. Next we read:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>20</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a
        few days because of the love he had for her. <sup>21</sup>Then Jacob
        said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is
        completed." Genesis 29:20-21.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    What love it had been that seven years would seem like a few days. Then
    Jacob went to Laban and asked for Rachel so he could "go in to her." The
    reason he was asking was that he had completed his seven years of service
    for her. "Going in to her" is a euphemism for marital intimacy. In effect
    Jacob was saying that he had not violated Rachel's virginity even though he
    had been with Laban seven years.
</p>
<h2>
    Jacob Marries the Wrong Woman
</h2>
<p>
    Next Scripture reports on the wedding celebration:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a
        feast. <sup>23</sup>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and
        brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <sup>25</sup>And in the
        morning behold, it was Leah! And Jacob said to Laban, What is this you
        have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you
        deceived me?" <sup>26</sup>Laban said, "It is not so done in our
        country, to give the younger before the firstborn." Genesis 29:22-23,
        25-26.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The passage does not say how Laban switched daughters but it clearly states
    he successfully did. In the morning Jacob was outraged and accused Laban of
    deception. He said, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with
    you for Rachel?" Why then have you deceived me? (Genesis 29:25). Clearly
    Jacob had fulfilled his end of the bargain. He had served seven years for
    Rachel. Laban affirmed it by explaining a previously unmentioned custom,
    that the oldest daughter had to be married first.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        The Traditional Approach: Marriage before the Years of Service
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Astonishingly, the leading advocate of the 215-year approach, Archbishop
    James Ussher as well as others to this day say this wedding celebration
    took place before Jacob had served any of the 14 years. In complete
    disregard to the words of the Bible Ussher offers the following chronology:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1759 BC - Jacob flees from Esau to Haran</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1758 BC - Leah bears Reuben</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1757 BC - Leah bears Simeon</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1756 BC - Leah bears Levi</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1755 BC - Leah bears Judah</strong>
    <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a>
</p>
<p>
    Ussher's chronology above shows Jacob to have fathered his firstborn the
    year following his arrival in Haran. Since Leah was the mother, by
    implication both daughters became wives of Jacob at the beginning of his
    20-year stay with Laban. Ussher's dates show he believed Leah's first four
    sons were born just one year apart beginning one year after Jacob's arrival
    in Haran. Why would he and those holding the 215-year view to this day
    contradict the clear words of Scripture? The following three reasons are
    offered; this chapter shows that each was unsound.
</p>
<p>
    1. Scripture relates a sequence of births one after another, not several at
    the same time.
</p>
<p>
    2. All the children were born by the time Jacob had been with Laban 14
    years because of the six year work contract
</p>
<p>
    3. The children had to be several years older than they would be if he
    worked seven years before receiving his bride(s) because of later events in
    the life of Jacob.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Confirming Marriage to Leah; Serving for Rachel</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Back to our story. Laban had a solution:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>27</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        [Laban said] "Complete the week of this one [Leah], and we will give
        you the other [Rachel] also in return for serving me another seven
        years." <sup>28</sup>Jacob did so, and completed her [Leah's] week [of
        wedding celebration]. Then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his
        wife. Genesis 29:27-28. (Our words in brackets.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Laban's solution was that Jacob could have Rachel as well as Leah for seven
    more years of service. He only asked that Jacob fulfill the week of wedding
    celebration with Leah and then he would give Jacob Rachel as well. The
    solution seemed straight forward. Jacob was to complete the very public
    marriage celebration to the older sister. There would be no doubt in
    anyone's mind that he was married to her. After the festivities he would be
    given the younger sister as well and then serve Laban seven more years for
    the second wife.
</p>
<p>
    This new offer meant Jacob would continue to celebrate his marriage to Leah
    for the remaining six days-no public scene denouncing Laban as a deceiver,
    no cold shoulder to Leah; rather, pleasant, cheerful, celebrating. Jacob
    had not planned to be a bigamist. Both his father and grandfather were
    one-woman type of men. For seven years thoughts about Rachel had helped him
    through each exhausting day. Her presence lit up his life. He had no
    interest in any other woman.
</p>
<p>
    Jacob was over a barrel. He wanted Rachel with all his heart. He would do
    almost anything for her. Further he was a decent man and didn't want to
    denounce Leah. Wittingly or not, he had spent the night with her. Who would
    want her now? He was undoubtedly angry and probably confused and he didn't
    have the luxury of time to think it over. Scripture records his decision
    and Laban's response: "Jacob did so and completed her week. Then Laban gave
    him his daughter Rachel to be his wife" (Genesis 29:28). So Jacob said
    "uncle" and soon had twice as many wives as he ever intended. Nine months
    later Leah gave Jacob his first son, sealing her status as his wife.
</p>
<p>
    Laban's plan was a complete success. His older daughter who had attracted
    no successful suitor was very publicly wedded to Jacob. Laban's honor was
    intact. He would have no old maid daughter languishing in his house. Most
    likely at least his household knew what he had done but woe to the person
    who questioned his actions. Thus was the power of the family patriarch in
    his day.
</p>
<h3>
    Problem of the Sequence of Children's Births
</h3>
<p>
    The genealogists say the Scripture tells the sequence of the children's
    births. This sequence requires approximately fourteen years. The only way
    to find that much time is for Laban to have given his two daughters to
    Jacob at the beginning of Jacob's 20-year stay. We suggest that on
    occasion, Scripture groups similar events and thoughts before going back
    over the same time frame to report other events and thoughts. The following
    are examples of Scriptural grouping:
</p>
<p>
    Esau's genealogy is inserted between the death of Isaac and Joseph's story.
    Genesis 35 ends with the death of Isaac. Genesis 36 chronicles 500 years of
    Jacob's twin brother's line. Genesis 37:1 actually backtracks to events
    before Isaac's death. Thus 500 years of Edomite history are inserted in the
    middle of the Jacob/Joseph narrative.
</p>
<p>
    Genesis 2:5 returns to day six of creation week after Genesis 1:1-2:3
    reports the full seven days. The sons of Japheth are listed in Genesis
    10:2-5, then the descendants of Ham (10:6-20) and finally the descendants
    of Shem (10:21-31). No one would dispute that division of history, but
    Genesis 10 would be very confusing if it reported each birth as it
    happened. Genesis 11:27-32 reports the record of Terah before taking up
    God's dealing with Abraham which reaches back to his call in Ur (Genesis
    12-24) 10 or 15 years before. Genesis 35:28-29 reports the death of Isaac
    even though it happened 13 years after the selling of Joseph in Genesis 37.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, we believe that because several mothers were expecting at the
    same time and therefore births overlapped, the writer chose to group the
    births of Jacob's children: Leah's first four, then Bilhah's two, then
    Zilpah's two, then Leah's final three and lastly Rachel's son. Because of
    overlapping pregnancies, twelve children were born in just 10 years.
</p>
<h3>
    Twelve Births in Ten Years
</h3>
<p>
    Over the next ten years Jacob fathered eleven sons plus a daughter. But the
    other side can only see seven years available for these 12 children if
    Jacob served seven years before he received two wives and then six years
    for the cattle. Thus they manipulate Scripture to make more time. We will
    see that ten years were available and that ten years was sufficient. But
    first, we must acknowledge that this was the work of God. The odds of
    having eleven sons in a row are enormous. God was behind all this and the
    goal was our salvation, Jesus Christ, Jacob's ultimate seed and the defeat
    of Satan. Scripture does not tell us all the details of the scenario God
    used. Because some insist it was impossible, we suggest one scenario that
    is entirely consistent with Scripture. While the following is speculative,
    it honors Scripture.
</p>
<p>
    When the week of celebrating Jacob's marriage to Leah was over, Laban
    quietly gave Jacob his younger daughter as well. Jacob immediately
    transferred to Rachel's bedroom and spent nearly all of his time there for
    the next 13 years. At first possibly this was a family secret but in time
    it simply became accepted as the way things were. This transfer of bedrooms
    is apparent from the names Leah chose for her six boys and the mandrake
    event. She called her firstborn Reuben "Because," she said, "the LORD has
    looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will love me." (Genesis
    29:32). How was she afflicted? How was she unloved? Her husband paid her no
    attention. He spent his nights in Rachel's tent. Score: Leah-1; Rachel-0.
    Elapsed time: 9 months since the marriage.
</p>
<p>
    Jacob knew about conception. Animal breeding was his life. To say he was a
    successful animal breeder would be an understatement. He became wealthy
    through his breeding skills. In the next few years Jacob discovered that
    Leah was a virtual baby machine, and sons at that! Leah would deliver a son
    and six months later she would conceive again-spacing boys about 15 months
    apart. Rachel had not conceived in nine months while Leah conceived that
    very first week. So about 6 months after Leah's first delivery, Jacob began
    visiting her bedroom until she became pregnant again. But then he went back
    to Rachel. Scripture tells us as much. Leah named her second son Simeon
    "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated." (Genesis 29:33). Hated? Yes.
    Her husband spent his nights with Rachel, not with Leah. Score: Leah-2;
    Rachel-0. Elapsed time: 24 months since the marriage (9+6+9=24).
</p>
<p>
    About 6 months after Leah's second delivery, Jacob returned and soon she
    was expecting a third time. A total of 30 months had elapsed (9+6+9+6=30).
    This may have been when a new development unfolded. Rachel engaged Jacob in
    a heated argument. She demanded he make her pregnant. He said he was not
    God. Well, if he couldn't make her pregnant, he must give her a child by
    her handmaid, Bilhah. Jacob must have thought, "Is a third wife the price
    of peace?" With that, Bilhah conceived and behold, another boy. This son
    was born shortly after Leah's third. Score: Leah-3; Rachel-1. Elapsed time
    since Jacob's marriage: 42 months (30+9+3=42).
</p>
<p>
    Six months after her third delivery, Leah became pregnant a fourth time.
    About three months later, Bilhah became pregnant with her second. So
    fifty-four months after her marriage, Leah mothered a fourth son
    (9+15+15+15=54) while Bilhah delivered her second son three months later.
    For the first time Leah did not complain about her husband's absence.
    Instead she said, "This time I will praise the Lord." (Genesis 29:35).
    Score: Leah-4; Rachel-2; Elapsed time since Jacob's marriage: 57 months
    (54+3=57). Jacob now has six sons in just four and three-quarter years.
</p>
<p>
    When Leah didn't get pregnant as she usually did about six months after the
    birth of her fourth son, she became uneasy. Maybe Bilhah became pregnant
    for a third time which would later prove to be a girl, but Leah would not
    know it at the time. Leah must have fretted, "Rachel is catching up! I must
    do something. Rachel enlisted her handmaid. I'll do the same with my
    handmaid Zilpah." As to Laban's thoughts on the matter, he was already
    bragging to his men friends: "You hear? Six grandsons in less than five
    years. Isn't that a record?"
</p>
<p>
    At the same time Jacob may have been thinking, "God, you said, 'Your
    offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad
    to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you
    and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
    (Genesis 28:14). God, I had no idea, but if this is how, so be it." So when
    Leah offered her handmaid, Jacob went for broke. Nine months later Zilpah
    delivered a son. Score: Leah-5; Rachel-2 (plus possibly a girl from
    Bilhah). Elapsed time: 72 months or six years (57+6+9=72).
</p>
<p>
    Six months after the birth of Zilpah's first son, Jacob came again and
    Zilpah became pregnant with a second son. When she delivered him nine
    months later, Leah named him Asher which connotes happiness. This indicates
    Leah was not displeased that her husband had fathered two sons through her
    handmaid. Score: Leah-6; Rachel-2. Elapsed time: 87 months or 7 years and
    three months (72+15=87).
</p>
<p>
    Genesis 30:14 reports that little Reuben came in from the field with
    mandrakes (love apples-thought to help in conceiving). Rachel asked Leah
    for some. Apparently Jacob had given up on Rachel conceiving even though he
    still shared her bed. As for Leah, Jacob hadn't come to her tent for nearly
    a year and a half (the last time was six months after the birth of her
    fourth son when she did not conceive). Leah struck the following bargain:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>15</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        But she [Leah] said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken
        away my husband? Would you take away my son's mandrakes also?" Rachel
        said, "Then he may lie with you tonight in exchange for your son's
        mandrakes." <sup>16</sup>When Jacob came from the field in the evening,
        Leah went out to meet him and said, "You must come in to me, for I have
hired you with my son's mandrakes." So he lay with her that night.        <sup>17</sup>And God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob
        a fifth son. Genesis 30:15-17.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Here we read that Leah had to hire her husband for a single night some
    seven years and four sons after they were married! Clearly, Jacob did not
    divide his time between Leah and Rachel. Leah who hoped for the attention
    of her husband came to derive happiness from her sons and from the Lord who
    answered her prayer for a fifth son. Maybe Jacob was still blind to her
    worth, but who cared when the hugs of little boys never ceased, and
    grandfather Laban swelled with pride.
</p>
<p>
    Note that Scripture does not indicate that Leah's fifth pregnancy followed
    Zilpah's second pregnancy. Rather, Scripture groups Zilpah's two
    pregnancies together just as it grouped Bilhah's two pregnancies together.
    We suggest that Leah rested for two years after the birth of Judah and then
    became pregnant for the fifth time when Jacob visited her tent for a single
    night six and a half years after their marriage. Fifteen months later Jacob
    visited again and Leah became pregnant with her sixth son. Fifteen months
    later Jacob visited again and Leah became pregnant with her first daughter.
</p>
<p>
    To summarize, Rachel's handmaid carried sons during Leah's 3<sup>rd</sup>
    and 4<sup>th</sup> pregnancies while Leah's handmaid carried pregnancies
    towards the end of Leah's 24 month resting period and again during her
    fifth pregnancy. Rachel delivered Joseph shortly before Leah's first
    daughter was born, maybe three months before. By this scenario, the total
    time involved from Jacob's week-long marriage celebration to Leah to the
birth of Dinah was 117 months (9+3*15+24+9+2*15=117)    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>. 117 months is nine years
    and nine months. Final score: eight sons and one daughter for Leah's team;
    three sons and an unreported number of daughters for Rachel's team.
</p>
<p>
    Rachel also learned to look to God rather than Jacob during this time:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>22</sup></strong>
    <strong>
Then God remembered Rachel and God listened to her and opened her womb.        <sup>23</sup>She conceived and bore a son and said, "God has taken away
        my reproach." <sup>24</sup>And she called his name Joseph, saying, "May
        the LORD add to me another son!" Genesis 30:22-24.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The paragraph before the birth of Joseph concludes with "Afterward she
    (Leah) bore a daughter and called her name Dinah." (Genesis 30:21). The
    writer grouped Leah's last three births together, but indicated that
    Joseph's birth came before Dinah's birth. In this way all of the children
    were born within the birthing years of Leah. This is not the only scenario
    that could be devised, but whichever one it was, Scripture says it was
    successful. Who is man to change what God said happened?
</p>
<p>
    The scenario we use places Joseph's birth at 114 months (9.5 years) after
    Jacob received his two wives. When Joseph was born is the key to the age of
    Jacob and his children. He was 130 when he appeared before Pharaoh (Genesis
    47:9) and Joseph was 39. [Joseph was elevated at the age of 30 (Genesis
    41:46) and officiated over seven years of plenty and two years of famine
    when he stood with his father before pharaoh (30+7+2=39)]. Therefore,
    Joseph was born when Jacob was 91 (130-39=91). We suggest that about three
    and a half years later Jacob returned to Canaan and was 94.5 years old.
    Thus, he arrived in Haran at the age of 74 and was married at the age of 81
    (74+7=81). Since Scripture doesn't work with fractions of a year, we need
    to work with the whole number of departing Haran at the age of 94.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, this is our view: Jacob served Laban seven years, then married
    Leah and Rachel and fathered twelve children in the next ten years. Sadly,
    the numbers-over-words approach is that more years were needed and
    concluded Laban gave his two daughters to Jacob shortly after he first
arrived. Thus by silence in the case of Ussher in    <em>The Annals of the World</em>, and through explaining Scripture away in
    the case of his modern counterparts, inerrancy is violated. Where is faith
    in all this? Inerrancy requires us to accept what God has clearly said, not
    follow our own reasoning. Unfortunately, the inerrancy view continues to be
    rejected to this day.
</p>
<p>
    However, first an observation is in order. Early Bible history emphasizes
    sons. The genealogies from Adam to Noah and from Seth to Abraham are
    records of sons begetting sons. Some fathers had multiple wives. No lines
    are recorded in terms of daughters begetting daughters; wives having
    multiple husbands is likewise unrecorded. When Jacob fled from Laban,
    Genesis 31:17 reports, "So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on
    camels." Yet when Jacob moved his people to Egypt, Genesis 46:5-7 says,
    "Then Jacob set out from Beersheba... and came into Egypt, Jacob and all
    his offspring with him, his sons and his sons' sons, his daughters, and his
    sons' daughters&#8230;."
</p>
<p>
    "Daughters" is plural, yet only Dinah is said to have been born to him in
    all his years. Because of the emphasis on "sons," it is possible that the
    handmaids of Leah and Rachel bore unnamed daughters to Jacob either before
    or after he left Haran. Since the Scripture is silent about when one or
    more other daughters were born to Jacob, we need to be aware that possibly
    during the birth of the eleven sons in Haran, one or more other daughters
    were also born to him. We make this point because sometimes interpreters
    state dogmatically what Scripture does not actually say. In honoring the
    principle of inerrancy, we must diligently stand where Scripture stands and
    be tentative where Scripture is silent. This principle will become
    particularly important as we look at individual genealogies later on.
</p>
<h3>
    Problem of the Timing of Jacob's Contract
</h3>
<p>
    The 215-year people also say Jacob's wages supports their view, with the
    following line of thinking. Jacob requested being sent away as soon as his
    eleventh son, Joseph, was born. Laban urged Jacob to stay with him and
    offered to let him name his wages. Since Jacob later said he served 14
    years for Laban's two daughters and six years for Laban's flock, the
    standard approach jumps to the conclusion that this request and Joseph's
    birth occurred 14 years after Jacob joined Laban and six years before he
    departed from Laban. We will show that there were multiple wage contracts
    and clearly, this was not the one that began the final six years, thus
    invalidating their argument.
</p>
<p>
    The relevant Scripture is found in Genesis 30-31:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>25</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        As soon as Rachel had borne Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me away,
        that I may go to my own home and country. <sup>26</sup>Give me my wives
        and my children for whom I have served you, that I may go, for you know
        the service that I have given you. <sup>27</sup>But Laban said to him,
        "[stay with me] &#8230;. <sup>28</sup>Name your wages&#8230;" Genesis
        30:25-28.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        [Jacob said] "These twenty years I have been in your house. I served
        you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your
        flock, and you have changed my wages ten times." Genesis 31:41.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    While their logic seems plausible, nowhere does Scripture say Joseph was
    born at the end of the fourteen years. Neither does it say that this labor
    contract began the six years for the flock. But it does quote Jacob twice
    saying that Laban changed his wages ten times (to his wives in 31:7 and to
    Laban in 31:41). Eleven contracts? Once a search is made for evidence of
    changed wages and Jacob's claim is justified, we will realize that Ussher
    and followers commit the logical fallacies of jumping to conclusions and
    arguing from silence. So, when was the first agreement made? The last? And
    what about the one that is recorded?
</p>
<p>
    We suggest that various informal arrangements were made and then broken by
    Laban before the most important one, the one that is recorded. Some were
    made even before the fourteen years were completed. This is suggested by
    Jacob's later angry response to Laban:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>38</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        These twenty years I have been with you. Your ewes and your female
        goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your
        flocks. <sup>39</sup>What was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to
        you. I bore the loss of it myself. From my hand you required it,
        whether stolen by day or stolen by night. <sup>40</sup>There I was: by
        day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from
        my eyes. Genesis 31:38-40.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    How could Jacob bear the loss? How could it be required of his hand if he
    had no sheep or goats of his own to pay with before those final six years?
    Females were kept to multiply the flock while males were eaten, but Jacob,
    in spite of having a growing household, ate none of Laban's goats. Only if
    Laban paid Jacob with animals or allowed Jacob to begin building a flock of
    his own during those fourteen years could he feed his family and repay
    Laban for animals that had been torn or stolen.
</p>
<p>
    At the fourteen year mile stone a more formal arrangement was made so he
    could begin to acquire camels and cows as well as flocks. While Scripture
    does not record this agreement, it alludes to such an arrangement with the
    words about serving six years for the flocks. But when Laban saw Jacob
    truly prospering, he would have repeated his practice of changing Jacob's
    wages time and again.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    Wage Agreement Reported in Scripture
</h3>
<p>
    Finally when Joseph was born, Jacob became very assertive and said "Send me
    away." This time Laban, fearing he was about to lose Jacob, let Jacob name
    his wages and Jacob stayed on. This is the wage arrangement reported in
    Genesis 30: 25-28. It happened just after the birth of Joseph. Dinah was
    born several months later. If the final six years were a rounded number and
    the actual duration were six years and three months, Jacob would have left
    Laban three and a half years after Dinah's birth (according to our proposed
    scenario). When Jacob did leave, he left with an enormous number of
    healthy, young animals. Jacob's practices did not produce this bounty. It
    came from God who provided both his enormous herds and his sons.
</p>
<p>
    Why was Laban desperate to retain Jacob's services? He himself said, "The
    LORD has blessed me because of you" (30:27). Jacob states this even more
    strongly: "For you had little before I came, and it has increased
    abundantly, and the LORD has blessed you wherever I turned" (30:30).
    Jacob's service increased Laban's wealth from "little" to "abundant."
</p>
<p>
    This recorded agreement was to begin by Jacob passing through all Laban's
    flock and removing "every speckled, and spotted sheep and every black lamb,
    and the spotted and speckled among the goats" (Genesis 30:32) for himself.
    What actually happened? Somehow Laban distracted Jacob or took advantage of
    Jacob's work schedule and while Jacob was busy with other things, Laban
    with his sons rushed out and removed all such sheep and goats and sent them
    far away with his sons so Jacob would never get any of them back. Laban
    violated that contract before the ink was dry.
</p>
<p>
    On average sheep produce lambs once a year although they can bear in both
    the spring and fall. Three years is about the minimum time to replace most
    of Laban's black and white animals with striped and spotted animals by
    normal births, but with the hand of God guiding the genetics the process
    was miraculously shrunk into the available time.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    God Overrules Laban's Wage Changes
</h3>
<p>
    Jacob tells Rachel and Leah about two other changes to his wages after the
    agreement recorded in Scripture: "If he (Laban) said, 'The spotted shall be
    your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted" (31:8). In other words, when
    Laban saw that all (or most of) of the kids were striped, mottled or
    spotted which he originally said would be Jacob's wages, he reneged,
    limiting Jacob's wages to just those with spots. Jacob continued: "if he
    said, 'The striped shall be your wages', then all the flock bore striped."
    In other words, when Laban saw all the kids were spotted, he changed the
    wages to those kids with stripes and the next time around, all the kids
    were striped. Every time Laban changed Jacob's wages, the flocks bred in
    Jacob's favor! Jacob realized that God was doing this: "But God did not
    permit him to harm me" (31:7). God was overruling Laban's changes. "Thus"
    (Jacob concluded) "God has taken away the livestock of your father and
    given them to me." (31:8-9).
</p>
<p>
    Even more evidence for the wage changing game comes in the form of a dream
    God gave Jacob. He told Rachel and Leah, "The angel of God said to me in
    the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said, 'Here I am!' And he said, 'Lift up your
    eyes and see, all the goats that mate with the flock are striped, spotted,
    and mottled, for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you'" (31:11-12).
    What was God's point? In the field all mating goats that were not
    completely black had been removed and set aside. But in the dream, all the
    remaining mating goats, the ones belonging to Laban, were also
    multicolored, thus insuring their kids would be multicolored and thus
    belong to Jacob. Jacob would understand the same thing to be true of the
    flocks of sheep.
</p>
<p>
    Laban should have known that he couldn't cheat God. God would simply have
    all the kids and lambs marked with Laban's most recent wage change. When
    Jacob told Rachel and Leah his dream, they agreed with Jacob that they
    should move to Canaan, concluding that their father was cheating them out
    of what was rightfully theirs:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>
    <strong>
Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?        <sup>15</sup>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold
        us, and he has indeed devoured our money. <sup>16</sup>All the wealth
        that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our
        children. Genesis 31:14-16.
    </strong>
</p>
<h3>
    Time for Jacob to Leave
</h3>
<p>
    Sheep were sheared before the hot summer but after spring lambing. It could
    be this master contract was negotiated before spring birthing and shearing,
    allowing Jacob to accumulate his animals over four birthing seasons, even
    though only 3 &#189; years passed. Thus when he left, most of his oldest
    animals were just over three years old and the youngest had been born
    within the previous three months.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe this is why Laban removed the multicolored animals for himself once
    he realized that the animals had already mated the previous fall. The
    possibility of four birthing seasons would answer any who might maintain
    that Laban's flocks couldn't be transferred to Jacob in just three birthing
    seasons. As previously pointed out, the six years and twenty years are
    round numbers. The six years could be 6 &#188; years. The twenty years
    could be 20 &#188; years. Leah's daughter could have been born 9 &#190;
    years after Jacob received his wives. These number would provide 3 &#189;
    years from this master contract until Jacob departed. In that case it could
    have involved four mating seasons and four birthing seasons.
</p>
<p>
    As God increased Jacob's wealth, Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were
    saying, "Jacob has taken all that was our father's" (Genesis 31:1).
    Further, Jacob saw "that Laban did not regard him with favor as before"
    (Genesis 31:2). An alarming number of Laban's animals had become Jacob's.
    He was no longer their workhorse, multiplying their wealth. Jacob
    attributed the deed to God: "God has taken away the livestock of your
    father and given them to me" (Genesis 31:9). But jealousy was replacing
    their approval of Jacob. Jealousy can be deadly. Jacob was in danger. At
    this point God told Jacob to return to his homeland (Genesis 31:3).
</p>
<p>
    But how could he leave? For twenty years Jacob had seen Laban's
    highhandedness. He believed Laban would never let him return to Canaan with
    his family and wealth. Both he and Laban said as much. Laban later said,
    "You have driven away my daughters like captives&#8230;" Laban called
    Jacob's children "my sons and my daughters..." (Genesis 31:26, 28). They
    didn't belong to Jacob, they belonged to him and as head of the household,
    he intended to keep what was his. Further, he would threaten, "It is in my
    power to do you harm" (Genesis 31:29). Jacob would reply, "If the God of my
    father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side,
    surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed" (Genesis 31:42). This
    was the power of the patriarch. Laban could allow Jacob to go out with his
    family and wealth or let him leave empty-handed. Jacob had no choice but to
    flee secretly. Laban pursued and overtook Jacob. God intervened. Jacob was
    able to keep his family and newly formed wealth.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    Counting Jacob's Wealth
</h3>
<p>
    How much had God given Jacob? How many animals did Jacob have to move?
    Genesis 30:43 reports that Jacob "increased greatly and had large flocks,
    female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys." In Genesis 32:5
    he sent the following word to Esau: "I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male
    servants and female servants." He gave the following present to his brother
    Esau:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>14</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and
        twenty rams, <sup>15</sup>thirty milking camels and their calves, forty
        cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys. Genesis
        32:14-15.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jacob's gift amounted to 550 animals plus calves. At Bethel twenty years
    before, Jacob had promised God a tenth if God brought him back home
    (Genesis 28:22-22). If this was that tenth, he possessed over 5000 animals
    which was nearly half as many animals as Job had before Satan's attack. Yet
    most of Jacob's were acquired in just six years! Indeed, only God could
    have provided such increase.
</p>
<h3>
    Jacob's Escape: How Do the Numbers Work Out?
</h3>
<p>
    Multiplying Jacob's livestock was one thing. Returning them to the home of
    his father was another. How did Jacob do it? Here is a possible scenario:
    Jacob's nursing flocks could cover ten miles at most in a day without
    injury. It was about 500 land miles to his father in Hebron and almost 400
    miles to the hill country of Gilead where Jacob thought he might be safe.
    Yet it was there that Laban and his kinsmen overtook Jacob. How could Jacob
    have gotten so far in such a short time? Or did he have more time?
    Scripture sometimes summarizes an event that involved much more than is
    stated as we shall shortly see.
</p>
<p>
    But first, Jacob's escape and Laban's pursuit:
</p>
<p>
    <strong><sup>17</sup></strong>
    <strong>
        So Jacob arose and set his sons and his wives on camels. <sup>18</sup>
        He drove away all his livestock, all his property that he had gained,
        the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to
        go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.... <sup>21</sup>He fled
        with all that he had and arose and crossed the Euphrates, and set his
        face toward the hill country of Gilead. <sup>22</sup>When it was told
        Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled, <sup>23</sup>He took his
        kinsmen with him and pursued him [Jacob] for seven days and followed

        21-23.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Three critical details are disclosed in these verses. First, he had camels
    for transportation which meant speed and endurance. Second, he had to cross
    the Euphrates which was the major barrier between Haran and Hebron. Third,
    his goal was to reach the hill country of Gilead.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Route to Home</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The standard trade route from Haran to Egypt involved crossing the
    Euphrates River at the last down river place it could be forded on foot-the
    ancient city of Carchemish, 65 miles due west of Haran. From the story of
    Joseph being sold by his brothers, we learn that shepherds took their
    flocks many miles to find pasture. Jacob would surely have located his
    flocks in the direction of the escape route. From Carchemish the trade
    route went southwest for 80 miles to Aleppo and then south another 35 to
    Ebla. The trade route continued directly south for another 170 miles to
    Damascus. Seventy-five miles beyond Damascus one reached the hill country
    of Gilead which was directly east of the Sea of Galilee in the Jordan Rift
    Valley.
</p>
<p>
    However, determining specifics are difficult since at least three unknowns
    are involved in Jacob's return home. First, we only know the general area
    of Laban's ranch-Paddan-aram and Haran. Paddan-aram was a region while
    Haran was the major supply center on the trade route. The ranch could have
    been 20-30 miles from Haran. Second, we do not know for sure that Jacob
    crossed at the common fording of Carchemish. While that was the normal
    fording point a millennium later, the river could have changed much between
    Jacob's day and when better records were kept later. Third, we do not know
    where along the hills of Gilead Laban finally overtook Jacob. Four hundred
    years later that area was given to two and a half of Israel's twelve
    tribes. At that time, it was generally to the east of the Sea of Galilee.
    But it is possible that in Jacob's day the area nominally extended north
    for a distance. Thus, our best effort is an estimated 400 miles from
    Laban's ranch to the point where he overtook Jacob.
</p>
<p>
    When God told Jacob to return home He added, "I will be with you" (Genesis
    31:3). Jacob would have divine protection. Nevertheless, Jacob had to plan
    his escape carefully. He waited until Laban would be shearing his sheep
    several days journey away from the ranch. He sent for his wives (possibly
    as Laban was setting out) to join him for a secret meeting in the fields.
    Laban's household must not know. Jacob made his case for fleeing. Once his
    wives consented each began the extensive preparations for the journey
    (keeping their secret from Laban's people).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Moving Sheep and Goats</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jacob's first concern would be to get the sheep and goats moving because
    with nursing young they could hardly do ten miles a day. Cattle are good
    for twice that while camels can be used for rapid travel. Since Scripture
    states that Laban overtook Jacob in the hills of Gilead after a seven day
    pursuit and this appears to have been nearly 400 miles, the flocks must
    have been on the road at least 40 days. So how does this work?
</p>
<p>
    Once Jacob secured his wives agreement to leave Laban, he would have worked
    at getting the flocks across the Euphrates. This means he would have
    accompanied the shepherds for this most difficult task. If his flocks were
    already grazing a three days' journey west of Laban's ranch, he would have
    spent most of a week getting them to and safely across the Euphrates. He
    would not be missed at the ranch as he was often in the fields with the
    flocks for periods of time.
</p>
<p>
    Today, for several miles near Carchemish the Euphrates divides into two
    channels with an island between the channels. Possibly at one place one
    could wade across the first channel, then find a shallow part of the second
    channel somewhere else to wade across. We don't know. Only the Scripture
    makes a point of saying that Jacob got all he had across the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
    Then he would cover the distance back to the ranch in two days to get his
    herds on the trail. This may have taken another week. By then the sheep and
    goats, divided into many flocks, would be 160 miles from the ranch (7 + 2 +
    7 = 16 days). Then Jacob would continue his plans to flee with his
    remaining household-wives, children, kindred and servants-closing out their
    lives in Haran and preparing for the long, perilous journey ahead. Possibly
    a trusted servant had been moving back and forth between the flocks, herds
    and ranch (on camel back) while Jacob's household prepared. By one excuse
    or another to Laban's people he may have been able to send off donkey
    trains of possessions during that week. When they were ready, possibly a
    week or so after the cattle left, Jacob's wives must have said their
    goodbyes. With that Jacob put his family on camels and his household moved
    out. Laban's people sent a runner to tell Laban. By this time the sheep
    would be 230 miles away (16 + 7 = 23 days).
</p>
<p>
    Camels were the finest all-around transportation in this part of the
    ancient world. In a caravan with heavy loads, they typically covered 25
    miles a day or three miles an hour. They actually could walk all day at
    four miles an hour, but to conserve their energy, the drivers walked rather
    than rode. This slowed the caravan down to the pace and endurance of the
    drivers. Camels had been known to travel a hundred miles a day when
    employed for military purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Laban's Pursuit</strong>
</p>
<p>
    On the third day Laban received word that Jacob had fled. Laban was
    shearing sheep. For Laban to take action, he first arranged care for the
    sheep being sheared, then made the three day journey back to the ranch and
    then organized an armed pursuit party on camels. Jacob would have about a
    ten day head start but that would not alarm Laban since the sheep with
    recently born lambs could only travel ten miles a day at most. What Laban
    had not counted on was that Jacob had sent the sheep ahead before returning
    to the ranch. By the time Laban was ready to pursue, the sheep were on the
    trail the equivalent of 33 days, 330 miles from Haran (23 + 3 +2 +3 + 2 =
    33 days). Meanwhile the herds had been on the trail 17 days so they would
    soon catch up with the flocks. Jacob and family had been on the trail ten
    days and were a good 250-300 miles from Haran. With camels they would soon
    catch up with the flocks, herds and donkey trains.
</p>
<p>
    Scripture says it took Laban seven days to overtake Jacob. Just days
    before, Jacob's cattle, donkeys and camels had all caught up with his
    flocks and they were now in the hill country of Gilead, 400 miles from
    Haran. Just as Jacob thought he was safe, Laban and his band appeared.
    While Laban had expected to find them just 170 miles from his ranch, it
    probably did not take him long to learn they were a great distance ahead of
    him so he would have gone into a forced day and night march. Even so for
    Laban to cover 400 miles in seven days, his camel army would have had to
    cover a punishing 55 miles a day. What an amazing flight on Jacob's part.
    What an amazing pursuit on Laban's part.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, it was not that Jacob had reached familiar ground that
    protected him but none other than God Himself who appeared to Laban in a
    dream and warned him not to harm Jacob. In the end Laban and Jacob
    covenanted not to cross into each other's lands for harm. Laban kissed his
    grandchildren and daughters and returned home. Again, the angels of God
    appeared to Jacob. (Genesis 32:1). God was doing as He had originally
    promised at Bethel.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Esau Advances with 400 Men</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Then Jacob learned that his twin brother Esau was coming with a small army.
    He sent everyone ahead and was left alone. Yet he was not alone. He
    wrestled all night. The struggle was both spiritual and physical.
    "Wrestling" suggests a night of fervent prayer. Yet he sustained a lifetime
    physical injury. In the end his opponent said "Your name shall no longer be
    called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and
    have prevailed." (Genesis 32:28). The new name has the connotation of power
    with God. Following this Jacob said, "I have seen God face to face and yet
    my life has been delivered" (Genesis 32:30). Jacob had encountered the
    preincarnate Christ.
</p>
<p>
    Esau and his 400 men arrived. It looked like the end. Instead, "Esau ran to
    meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they
    wept" (Genesis 33:4). Of this Jacob said: "I have seen your face, which is
    like seeing the face of God, and you have accepted me" (Genesis 33:10).
    Each visitation from God strengthened Jacob's faith.
</p>
<h4>
    Dinah's Humiliation
</h4>
<h4>
    Instead of returning to his father in Hebron, for some unexplained reason
    over the next 12 years Jacob first built a house in Succoth, then bought
    land and settled in Shechem. There his daughter Dinah "went out to see the
    women of the land" (Genesis 34:1). Dinah was now old enough to socialize
    with the village women. The text does not mention an escort. Genesis 34:2
    continues: "When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the
    land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humiliated her." Having
    eleven older brothers she was used to receiving a lot of attention from
    boys and undoubtedly knew how to give and take a lot of innocent
    playfulness. Whatever he saw attracted him like a fly to flypaper. Then he
    lost control.
</h4>
<p>
    At the least we can observe that Dinah acted indiscreetly. "Going out to
    see the women" suggests inexperience, an enlarging of her world. In all
    this visiting she must have met Shechem. She was poised, self-confident, a
    talker and playful. Maybe Shechem misinterpreted her innocent fun for
    something more. We have suggested she was fifteen years old. If she were
    older, she would know more about men outside of her family and be more
    careful. If she were much younger, she would be less desired as his wife.
    At fifteen she was a grown woman capable of marriage and suitable as a mate
    for the young prince. Fifteen fits the Scriptural chronology.
</p>
<p>
    Dinah had six natural older brothers while Jacob's other five sons were her
    step-brothers. Her oldest natural brother and Jacob's first was Reuben. He
    was ten years older than her. Her brothers were beyond indignant. Shechem
    loved Dinah and asked his father to get her for his wife. When Shechem's
    father asked Jacob to let his daughter marry his son, he said the two
    peoples could become one. Jacob's sons said the Hivites would have to be
    circumcised first. So, all the men of the village were circumcised. Then
    two of Dinah's natural brothers came and murdered all the men when they
    were in the most pain. These brothers, Simeon and Levi, were 23 and 22,
    eight and seven years older than Dinah.
</p>
<p>
    Thinking the sons had to be older people ask, "How could two young men kill
    all the men in an entire village?" First, they came on the third day when
    the men were sore. Intense pain can incapacitate. The village men had no
    strength to fight back. Second, this question reinforces an earlier
    suggestion in this paper, that Abraham had gained military training in Ur.
    When he left Ur, he trained every able-bodied male in his household in the
    art of defense. When the Jordan Valley was invaded and Lot was taken
    prisoner, Abraham "led forth his trained men, born in his house, 318 of
    them&#8230;" and with allies, completely vanquished an experienced,
    professional army (Genesis 14:14). That a 23- and 22-year-old could put an
    entire village to the sword suggests Jacob also trained his sons in the use
    of the sword. Today 23- and 22-year-old college football players display
    the kind of strength and determination that Jacob's sons displayed. The
    other side sees the need for the sons to be seven years older, but they
    didn't need to be 30 and 29 to wreak this havoc on the village.
</p>
<p>
    While the slaughter at Shechem possibly doubled Jacob's wealth, his focus
    was on his and his family's survival. He was angry and terrified expecting
    revenge from the Shechemites' fellow Canaanites. Little did he know that
    God would command Israel to destroy the Canaanite population five hundred
    years later. Could it be that the act of Simeon and Levi was divine
    judgment to break the hold of paganism on its surviving residents (over
    half of its population) and give them the opportunity to meet the true God
    and receive eternal life?
</p>
<h4>
    Returning to Bethel, the "House of God"
</h4>
<p>
    After Simeon and Levi slaughtering the adult males of the village, all of
    his sons plundered what was left and took the wives and children. Jacob was
    appalled at his sons' action. He said to Simeon and Levi, "You have brought
    trouble on me by making me stink to the inhabitants of the land, the
    Canaanites and the Perizzites. My numbers are few, and if they gather
    themselves against me and attack me, I shall be destroyed, both I and my
    household" (Genesis 34:30). Jacob must have cried out to God because we
    next read "God said to Jacob, 'Arise, go up to Bethel [Hebrew: beth-house;
    el-God; thus "house of God"] and dwell there. Make an altar there to the
    God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau'" (Genesis
35:1). God said to "dwell there," not "stop there" or "visit there."    <em>HB</em> finds he lived there for at least two years, until Joseph
    reached the age of 17, and possibly as many as three.
</p>
<p>
    Bethel would be a place of refreshment after years of stress and trouble.
    Jacob would find peace and quiet in the House of God. He told his household
    and all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you
    and purify yourselves and change your garments. Then let us arise and go up
    to Bethel, so that I may make there an altar to the God who answers me in
    the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone" (Genesis
    35:2-3). With him were his household plus many new faces--all those in the
    plunder of Shechem for Scripture previously reported: "They (Jacob's sons)
    took their (Shechem's) flocks and their herds, their donkeys, and whatever
    was in the city and in the field. All their wealth, all their little ones
    and their wives, all that was in the houses, they captured and plundered"
    (34:28-29).
</p>
<p>
    Everyone with him was to put away their false gods, follow rites of
    cleansing and change their clothes in preparation for meeting the LORD.
    Jacob buried these instruments of idolatry near Shechem and left for Bethel
    (Genesis 35:4). Along the way the Canaanites did not attack them. Instead
    "a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they
    did not pursue the sons of Jacob" (Genesis 35:6). At Bethel he built an
    altar which indicates animal sacrifice and worship. The women and children
    of Shechem had been the pitiful victims of idolatry. Here they learned
    about the true God. He must be approached through the blood of a sacrifice
    as man had done since the time of Abel. Each Old Testament sacrifice
    anticipated the ultimate and final sacrifice, that of Jesus Christ on the
    cross. Certainly, many of these newcomers believed in the true God and
    entered His Kingdom that day.
</p>
<p>
    Bethel was where God had first repeated to Jacob the promises of people and
    land He had given to Abraham and Isaac. In addition, God had promised that
    Jacob would return to this place. Now Jacob was again in this place. God
    had kept His promise. But not only had Jacob returned to this place, he had
    returned with a vast household and great wealth.
</p>
<p>
    For the sake of continuity, Scripture next records God's second appearance
    to him at Bethel. Then it continues with Jacob's journey back to Isaac,
    relating the death of Rachel near Bethlehem. Finally, Jacob reaches Hebron.
    Scripture closes this portion with the death of Isaac. In the next section
    Scripture tells about Joseph's rise in Egypt and Judah's family, both
    essential to Israel's becoming a nation and continuing the line of Christ.
    But <em>HB</em> seeks to show that the dates of Scripture provide a sound
    chronology without changing what it says. For this reason, the events that
    happened in Bethel are grouped together before the journey to Hebron.
    Scripture gives at least three clues: Joseph was 17 when his brothers sold
    him; Judah's marriage occurred "at this time" and Jacob built a pillar, not
    an altar when God appeared to him the second time. Each of these clues
    could consume considerable space, but <em>HB</em> will give them briefly
    and let the reader fill in the details.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Joseph-17 years old</strong>
    . He and Dinah were 15 when Dinah was violated and God told Jacob to go to
    Bethel and live there. Joseph was brilliant. Because Jacob was worn out, he
    began using Joseph to report on his brothers' management of Jacob's vast
    flocks and herds. He reported his brother's incompetence. They hated him,
    sold him into slavery and dipped his clothing in blood. Jacob concluded his
    son was killed by wild beasts and was crushed with grief. Since only two
    years is available after Shechem, Joseph's apparent death had to have
    happened at Bethel. His mother was still alive and Benjamin had not yet
    been born. Joseph saw Benjamin for the first time when his brothers brought
    him to Egypt. Scripture says Jacob grieved over Joseph and would not be
    comforted. This event broke Jacob and caused him to return to Hebron and
    the consolation his home would provide.
</p>
<p>
    "<strong>At that time</strong>" (Genesis 38:1) begins the story of Judah's
    marriage and family. It happened during the days Joseph was dreaming of
    dominance over his brothers and parents, during those two years when Joseph
    was Jacob's eyes and ears. Joseph was 15 when they arrived at Bethel and 17
    when his brothers sold him. Judah being six years older than Joseph was
    21-23 during the Bethel years. It couldn't have happened much earlier
    because it happened around the time that tragedy befell Joseph. It couldn't
    have happened much later because Egypt was just 22-23 years off and Judah
    would raise and marry off two sons during those 22-23 years.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>God's second appearance</strong>
    . God had confirmed the Abrahamic Covenant to him at this very place when
    he left home for Haran (Genesis 28:10-22). Now 32 plus years later God
    repeated those promises:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>11</sup>
        I am God Almighty [El Shaddai]: be fruitful and multiply. A nation and
        a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall come from
        your own body. <sup>12</sup>The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac,
        I will give to you, and I will give the land to your offspring after
        you. Genesis 35:11-12.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    God identified Himself as "El Shaddai," the all-powerful God. No less than
    the One who created all things in six days stood behind these promises to
    Abraham, Isaac and now Jacob. Further, God confirmed his new name "Israel"
    first given over 12 years before when he had wrestled with God all night.
    He hadn't been living up to his new name in Shechem. Now that he was living
    in Bethel, he was finally being "Israel" and God acknowledged that. This
    divine appearance happened after Jacob built the altar and offered
    sacrifice on it when his troop first arrived. This is clear because in
    response to this appearance, Jacob set up a pillar of stone and poured out
    both a drink offering and oil on it.
</p>
<p>
    But there were tears even at Bethel. There Deborah, Rebekah's nurse died
    and was buried under an oak. The place was named "Allon-bacuth" (oak of
    weeping; Genesis 35:8). Possibly this woman had cared for Jacob in his
    infancy and his mother as she aged. It is likely that when Rebekah died,
    her nurse came to help with all the children born to Jacob. In Jacob's
    household she became a pleasant reminder of his years in his parent's home.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>From Bethel to Hebron and finally to Egypt </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Crushed by the loss of Joseph Jacob headed for home. More grief visited the
    disheartened band. Jacob's beloved Rachel went into labor near Bethlehem
    which was then called Ephrath. Rachel had prayed for another son (Genesis
    30:24) and now God answered. The child Benjamin lived, but his mother died
    in childbirth. This was Jacob's twelfth and last son. Over a thousand years
    later Micah would prophecy that the most significant son in all human
    history would be born there. The second person of the godhead, God the Son,
    would become clothed with humanity in that very place.
</p>
<p>
    But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of
    Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel,
    whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days. Micah 5:2.
</p>
<p>
    In a single verse (Genesis 35:22) Scripture reports another disheartening
    event. His oldest son committed fornication with his beloved wife's
    handmaid, Bilhah. It was like violating the memory of Rachel. Scripture
    calls her "his father's concubine." Most likely, Bilhah bore some of
    Jacob's daughters. We don't hear any more of this until Jacob blesses his
    sons on his death bed. There he says to Reuben,
</p>
<p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might and the firstfruits of my strength,
    preeminent in dignity and preeminent in power. <sup>4</sup>Unstable as
    water, you shall not have preeminence, because you went up to your father's
    bed; then you defiled it-he went up to my couch! Genesis 49:2-3.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, Jacob arrived "at Mamre, or Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where
    Abraham and Isaac had sojourned" (Genesis 35:27). He had been away for 34
    years, the 20 with Laban plus the 14 in Shechem and Bethel. He had left
    home at the age of 74. Now he returned at the age of 108. During his
    absence Esau lived for a time with his parents, Isaac and Rebekah, who must
    have harbored a deep, quiet grief for Jacob. Esau no longer had to compete
    with Jacob who seemed unmatchable. As he became the sole heir of all his
    father had, he mellowed. Apparently, he eventually showed interest in the
    stories of God's appearances to his father and grandfather and finally
    believed. When Jacob returned from Haran, Esau had welcomed him home with
    tears, forgiving his brother who had purchased his birthright and stolen
    his father's blessing. God honored Esau with an entire chapter of the
    Bible, a long one at that, devoted to a 500-year record of his descendants
    (Genesis 36).
</p>
<p>
    Jacob enjoyed his father's company for just 12 years (1898-1886 BC).
    Genesis 35:28-29 report, "Now the days of Isaac were 180 years. And Isaac
    breathed his last, and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full
    of days. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him." Jacob was 120. Eight
    years later famine struck. Jacob was infirm but still surrounded by his
    family and still in control. What happened next requires the context that
    follows.
</p>
<p>
    The Ishmaelites had sold the slave Joseph to Potiphar, captain of Pharaoh's
    guard. Potiphar quickly realized Joseph was a good administrator and put
    him in charge of all he possessed. His wife found Joseph handsome. When
    Joseph refused her overtures, she falsely accused him and Potiphar placed
    him in the special prison where Pharaoh's prisoners were kept. Again, his
    genius was apparent and he came to be in charge of the prisoners. Then
    Joseph interpreted Pharaoh's dream and was made the governor of Egypt. Over
    the next seven years of plenty, due to his administrative skills the
    storage facilities of Egypt came to overflow with grain. Then began the
    seven years of famine and the arrival of his brothers. After shrewd
    testing, disclosed himself to them with tears.
</p>
<p>
    Since five years of famine remained, Joseph invited his family to move to
    Egypt. Pharaoh gave Jacob prized land in the Nile Delta (Goshen) nearest
    Canaan. Jacob appeared before Pharaoh and said he was 130 years old.
    Scripture identifies all his descendants who ended up in Egypt. Counting
    Jacob the party numbered 70 (Genesis 46:8-27). The Book of Exodus opens by
    repeating the names of Jacob's sons in Egypt and giving the same number for
    his party found in Genesis 46:27 (70). Jacob died 17 years later at the age
    of 147 (Genesis 47:28).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Lessons from Jacob's Genealogy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. Use of the term "son." In totaling the sons of each of Jacob's four
    wives, Scripture says "these are the sons of&#8230; Leah" (v15), "Zilpah"
    (v18), "Rachel (v22) and "Bilhah" (v24). In the list are sons, grandsons
    and even great grandsons. Also included in the count of sons borne by Leah
    is her husband, Jacob. Obviously, "son" can have a wider meaning than in
    typical genealogies. The various uses of kinship terms is the subject of
    the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
    2. Focus on sons. Of the 69 named individuals who descended from Jacob and
    comprised his household in Egypt, 67 were sons and just two were daughters.
    Specifically, it says that Leah bore 33 sons and daughters, even though it
    lists only one, Dinah. Seriah in verse 17 is the only other daughter found
    in the list. In using "daughter" in the plural, Scripture indicates that
    other daughters were born but are not listed. Since over time the number of
    sons and daughters balance out, several dozen daughters could have been
    omitted for this supposedly complete list.
</p>
<p>
    3. Focus on the future. In two clear cases unborn sons are listed. Perez's
    sons, Hezron and Hamul, were born years after the move to Egypt since Perez
    himself was born at the time of the move. Benjamin was just 22 at the time
    of the move, yet ten sons are listed for him. Most would have been born
    after the move. Why would a genealogy list unborn sons? This list shows
    that God is beginning the fulfillment of his promise to make Abraham's
    descendants without number.
</p>
<p>
    Because of these obvious differences from typical genealogies, unless the
    Bible interpreter thinks of genealogies as Hebrews did, he will make
    incorrect interpretations.
</p>
<p>
    Appendix Tables 4.1 and 4.2 compile Jacob's genealogy. A highly accurate
    list is possibly because Scripture gives so much detail to Jacob's life.
    Table 4.1 points out that whereas 38 specific dates or details are recorded
    concerning Isaac, 80 are found for Abraham and 158 relate to Jacob. Table
    4.2 dates with a high degree of reliability 30 specific details or events
    in his life producing an extremely accurate chronology.
</p>
<p>
    With HB's study of the lives of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, a reliable
    historical chronology can be established back to the birth of Abraham's
    father, Terah. Working backwards from the construction of Solomon's temple
    in 966 BC, the Exodus occurred 480 years before (1446 BC). Jacob moved his
    family to Egypt 430 years before that (1876). He was born 130 years before
    (2006 BC). Isaac was born 60 years before that in 2066 BC and Abraham was
    born 100 years before Isaac (2166 BC). Finally, Terah was born 130 years
    before Abraham (2296 BC). These numbers are found in Table 3.1. Tables B.1
    and B.2 use HB's findings of 35-55 generations missing between Eber and
    Peleg to produce historical chronologies both forwards and backwards
    between creation and the present.

            This scenario suggests all twelve children were born within Leah's
            birthing history of resting six months after pregnancies #1, #2,
            #3, #5, #6 and resting 24 months after pregnancy #4. The total time
            elapsed is nine months for each of her seven pregnancies (six sons
            and a daughter) for a total of 63 months, five rests of six months
            each for a total of 30 months, and the long 24 month rest between
            her 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> pregnancies. Thus her total
            birthing history was 63 months of pregnancies, 30 months of short
            resting periods and 24 months of the one long resting period. Total
            elapsed time: 63+ 30 + 24 or 117 months.
