<h2>
    Elasticity of Hebrew Genealogical Terms
</h2>
<p>
    Moving on from the errors that make genealogies obscure, hidden by layers
    of misinterpretation, we now arrive at the heart of this work: how God used
    genealogies to raise up a nation to give mankind a Savior.
</p>
<h4>
    Nature and Function of Biblical Genealogies
</h4>
<p>
    The biblical genealogies are elegant, profound, mysterious, practical,
    personal and flexible in nature. Most importantly, God himself established
    them.
</p>
<p>
    In elegance they can be a long list of immediate father-son relationships
    or as brief as "Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham"
    (Matthew 1:1).
</p>
<p>
    Profound-they identify the fathers of post-Flood people groups that
    repopulated the world.
</p>
<p>
    Mysterious-they speak of ten sons accompanying 24-year-old Benjamin to
    Egypt (a 24-year-old with ten sons?). Further, they include the two unborn
    sons of baby Perez among the 66 descendants of Jacob who went down to
    Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Flexible-they are not always a record of immediate father-son
    relationships; rather, they are elastic enough to include future
    descendants under the concept that all future generations are in the loins
    of their forefathers. In this way the record could be particularly tailored
    to meet the author's purpose with remarkable efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    In purpose and function they provide identity and explanation-who am I?
    Where do I belong? How did it happen? With brevity they record: 1) the
    spread of man after the Flood; 2) Abraham's ancestors; 3) Israel's
    organization.
</p>
<p>
    A three-tier division of Jacob's descendants (tribe/clan/household) insured
    brilliant organization and maximum security in the wilderness and fair
    division of the land in Canaan. In effect, the genealogies told each family
    where to pitch its tent in a camp of 2.5 million people and where to settle
    down in the spacious Promised Land. They especially confirm that Jesus was
    truly human. While biblical genealogies have similarities to the
    genealogies of monarchial societies through the ages, they also have
    significant differences and must be explained in a way consistent with
    biblical use.
</p>
<h4>
    Genealogies Organized Israel
</h4>
<p>
    Free at last; no longer slaves under the yoke of Egypt. But what would keep
    these former slaves from exploiting each other as they had been exploited?
    In a word, genealogies. The ex-slaves had to think and act like free people
    and stand together as a nation. To keep them from destroying each other
    before they learned those new ways, genealogies helped organize them so
    they would live together in a civilized way.
</p>
<p>
    When God delivered Israel from Egypt, He gave Moses an amazingly simple yet
    efficient way to organize the people. He grouped them by tribe, clan, and
    households that contained even smaller divisions. At the center of the camp
    in the wilderness was the Tabernacle. Surroundit was an open area large
    enough to assemble the nation. Beyond that the three clans of Levi camped
    on three sides of the Tabernacle while the families of Moses and Aaron
    camped in front. Beyond the Levites was an assembly area for common
    activities. Beyond this, possibly a mile from the Tabernacle, began the
    camps of the people. Three tribes camped side by side on each of the four
    sides, radiating out like wedges. Each tribe was divided into three to six
    clans, approximately 50-60 clans in all. Clans ranged from 10,000 to 50,000
    members. Divisions further extended to thousands, hundreds and tens. Adult
    males provided the basis for population counts.
</p>
<p>
    Each person living in his own unit restrained theft and promoted acceptable
    behavior. Everyone knew the people around them. Their neighbors were their
    relatives. Each witnessed the other's actions. Due to distances, people in
    one tribe had little association with people in another tribe. The life of
    each person centered around where his genealogy put him. Those Levites over
    the age of 50 were spared transporting the Tabernacle and became the guards
    at the heart of the nation. If an unauthorized person entered that inner
    circle, he was to be executed-except on those occasions where individuals
    or the entire nation were summoned to join Moses at the Tabernacle which
    was also called "The Tent of Meeting." One didn't just wander anywhere
    through the camp. People were born, married and died in their own
    organizational unit.
</p>
<p>
    So, a person's genealogy told him who he was, where he belonged, where he
    placed his tent and who his neighbors would be. Slaves could be ornery,
    stubborn. Sometimes it took a whip to keep them in line. Now the whip was
    gone. Genealogies were doing what the whip had done. Yes, the people were
    free from servitude in Egypt, but their freedom had limits. They didn't
    have to work for others twelve hours a day and they didn't have to spend
    their days confined to the work area of a slave gang, but God put an
    impressive amount of structure in their lives. Can we picture it?
</p>
<p>
    When this sea of people arrived at a new location, they set up their unit
    in relation to the whole. Tribal and clan leaders designated areas for
    tents, established corridors, marked and cleared open spaces for manna,
    designated the special places outside the camp and set up necessary
    services for the function of each unit. With practice they became
    efficient. The Tabernacle, first assembly space, Levite tent area and
    second open area must have stretched a mile in every direction from the
    center, the Tabernacle. Then came the tribes divided into clans and clans
    divided into households radiating out for another three miles or so.
</p>
<p>
    To be sure, there was more desirable real estate. The tribal and clan heads
    pitched their tents nearest the Tabernacle. Those of lesser position tented
    further out in their clan's living space. If the farthest tents were four
    miles from the Tabernacle, all people could collect at the Tabernacle and
    return to their tents the same day. This walk probably motivated families
    to earn the right to camp closer to the front of their tribe's wedge. This
    densely packed part of the camp would cover an area of over 50 square miles
    (4<sup>2</sup>*3.14).
</p>
<p>
    Joshua 7:24 says Achan had "oxen, donkeys and sheep." If these animals were
    kept in the camp their manure would foul the manna and the camp would be
    hopelessly spread out. More likely the herds and flocks were kept in
    specially designated areas outside the camp proper. Other specially
    designated areas would have been used for temporarily unclean individuals,
    for lepers, for burying the dead or disposing of waste, among others. These
    specially designated areas could have occupied a band three miles wide
    outside the living area. A camp 14 miles in diameter would have an area of
    150 square miles, the inner 50 for living and the outer 100 for specially
    designated functions. This vast distance explains why people mostly lived
    and mixed within their designated areas-tribes, clans, households, etc.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Daily Life in the Wilderness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Picture the people rising early to gather their daily portion of manna.
    Their desire for manna that was still fresh before the heat of the day
    spoiled it would have been adequate motivation to brave the nippy early
    morning desert cold. Perhaps each person spent the first hour or more
    gathering a day's worth. In this way God saw to it that each individual
    received sufficient daily exercise. If one area was gathered clean, people
    would have to search for areas that still had a supply. Manna was a perfect
    food but the effort required to gather it most likely limited over eating
    and thus becoming overweight.
</p>
<p>
    Then people would relax while they enjoyed the first meal of the day and
    chatted about the daily tasks needing attention. Young children would
    require the attention of mothers. Just carrying water might occupy a teens
    morning. Waste had to be carried to designated areas and buried. Others
    gathered wood, bartered and traded services and cooked meals while the
    600,000 men of the camp conducted their morning military drills. Herds and
    flocks were cared for. Professions and specialties were developed. Maybe
    all this was done before the sun was high in the sky and it was time for a
    long afternoon nap. There were many special days, days for instruction,
    days for their religious life and plenty of time to get into trouble for
    those so inclined. So went life for that vast multitude, thankfully
    protected by cloud from the burning daytime sun and by the pillar of fire
    during the cold desert night.
</p>
<p>
    Moses had an army to train and command. Like all generals he needed to know
    how many troops were available for the day. Most likely it was a day for
    training, but it might be a day for action. He must have taken a "morning
    report" as military commanders generally do. How would it work? Possibly at
    a certain time the horns were blown at headquarters for the morning report.
    The horns at each tribe a mile from the Tent of Meeting would repeat the
    call. Those in charge of ten had already made the rounds to determine the
    able bodied. When the horns sounded, each sprinted off to his captain of
    100 with his report.
</p>
<p>
    The captain of 100 made a quick tabulation and hurried to the next level,
    the captain of a thousand. Those reports went to the clan leaders who most
    likely were near the tents of the tribal leaders. The tribal leaders made
    their tallies and sent them with runners to the Tent of Meeting. Possibly
    this was all accomplished in just half an hour. The officials at the Tent
    of Meeting tabulated the twelve tribal reports. Moses and his staff
    determined the training activities for the day. The trumpets sounded a
    second time and the available men, usually over 600,000, did as the trumpet
    calls directed. Most likely, they assembled in front of their tribe, in the
    space between the Levites and the general body of people. There they
    carried out the orders of the day.
</p>
<p>
    God began this consciousness of being a nation with His original call to
    Abraham when He told him he would become a nation. God repeated this idea
    to Isaac and again to Jacob: "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for
    there I will make you into a great nation." Genesis 46:3. A record of those
    who went down to Egypt with Jacob is preserved in Genesis 46:8. Jacob's
    sons became the tribes of Israel. Clans and households arose from their
    descendants. Through the growth of a family, a nation was developing.
</p>
<h4>
    Difficulties in Following Genealogical Lists
</h4>
<p>
    Untangling Hebrew genealogies is challenging. The challenge begins with the
    person's name. Generally, just one name is given for a particular Hebrew in
    any given passage. Imagine how difficult it would be to keep people
    straight if everyone was "David" or "Mary" or "Bill" in today's society.
    One helpful device was naming certain people along with their father's name
    ("Joshua the son of Nun;" "Caleb the son of Jephthunnah"). Some names were
    quite popular even then so various people answered to the same name. In
    fact, more than one person answered to many of the names found in the Old
    Testament and in one case twenty-three people found in Scripture bore the
    same name. Families gave their sons the name of a beloved grandfather or
    famous ancestor. Abraham's grandfather and brother both bear the name
    "Nahor." Sometimes people were named after places special to families.
    Terah named Abraham's oldest brother, Haran, after the city by that name.
    To further complicate matters, some Hebrews were known by several names, so
    various authors used different names for the same person.
</p>
<p>
    Perhaps writing material was scarce or expensive, so Hebrew authors
    practiced brevity and efficiency in listing descendants. Because relational
    words (father, son, daughter, brother, sister) could be used narrowly or
    broadly, when we read "son of," for instance, it is often impossible to
    know if a particular list is condensed or complete. Thus, one cannot assume
    that the same name in two different places is the same individual or that a
    list of names is always inclusive. This is the most difficult challenge in
    sorting out Hebrew genealogies and the one that has led to the most
    distorted notions that claim to be based on the Word of God. This book
    would not be written if well-meaning, inerrancy-believing rank-and-file
    Christians had discerned that Hebrew genealogies were more often
    abbreviated than not.
</p>
<p>
    Having seen how, on the one hand, genealogies provided identification, but
    on the other hand are difficult to sort out, we will now turn to their use.
    First, we will look at the use of basic relational terms-father, son, etc.
    Immediately we are in for a shock until we learn to think the way Hebrews
    used those words. There was no word for "grandson" so the single word "son"
    covered all possibilities. A normal reaction will be skepticism, so
    numerous examples follow. Then we will proceed to more difficult (and more
    unbelievable) ways Hebrews rendered lists of their descendants. For
    instance, the total number of those going down to Egypt with Jacob included
    unborn sons on the one hand and omits most of the daughters on the other
    hand, even though we read, "All the persons belonging to Jacob who came
    into Egypt, who were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives
    were sixty-six persons in all" (Genesis 46:26).
</p>
<p>
    Building on this foundation, we take up case after case of abbreviated
    genealogies in chapter six. Wouldn't two or three examples do? Few are
    iron-clad. While this author has rendered his best judgment, some examples
    may be legitimately questioned. But with a preponderance of examples, the
    case becomes overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
    The light is coming. We have been encouraged by recently printed statements
    in standard young earth creation periodicals like "OK, maybe Israel was in
    Egypt 430-years, not 215," and "yes, perhaps, on occasion, Hebrew
    genealogies are abbreviated." The thinking of young earth creationists is
    going in the right direction. But we believe ample evidence exists that
    Shem's list in Genesis 11 also is condensed. Finally, with great reverence,
    we must realize that our Savior's genealogy is a Hebrew genealogy and it,
    too, is a matter of identity, not completeness.
</p>
<h4>
    Simple Hebrew Vocabulary
</h4>
<p>
    Biblical Hebrew had no words for relationships like grandfather, grandson,
    uncle, cousin, etc. The standard relationship words were words father,
    mother, son, daughter, brother and sister. So, when the word father was
    used, it might mean immediate father, but it also might mean grandfather or
    more distant ancestor. In the same way when the word son was used, it might
    mean immediate son, grandson or more remote descendant. The women said,
    "Naomi has a son," when in fact Ruth's baby was Naomi's grandson (Ruth
    4:17). The first verse of the New Testament says "Jesus, son of David, son
    of Abraham," when later verses show that Jesus lived many generations after
    David and David lived many generations after Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    The verb "to bear/to beget" (Hebrew-YLD) was used in the same general way.
    The one born might be the immediate offspring or a more distant offspring.
    But we only had four examples of YLD referring to a more distant offspring,
    so we sent an email to the Biblical Hebrew Dictionary asking if they could
    give further examples. We asked, "How could we be sure that YLD was used in
    the broad sense?
</p>
<p>
    Arie Uittenbogaard of Abarim Publications wrote, "Common knowledge. In
    Hebrew father- and motherhood extend beyond the primary biological
    generation."<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a> In effect
    this man was saying that examples are unnecessary. Among users of Hebrew,
    it is common knowledge that the verb "to bear/to beget" can be used for
    both immediate and later generations. As previously stated, the Hebrew
    concept is that all future generations are in the loins of the present
    generation and therefore the present generation produces all future
    generations. Thus, the Hebrews used these basic relational terms in both
    narrow and broad senses while more specific relationship terms are used
    inmost other languages.
</p>
<p>
    Flexible/elastic. A Hebrew genealogy could (and often did) contain both
    immediate descendants and more distant descendants without any indication
    that some intermediate generations were omitted. We can conclude this
    because of what we have already seen as well as what we are about to see
    again and again. Our original example was that of Kohath-Amram-Aaron which
    reads like they were immediate father-son relationships. While Amram was
    the immediate son of Kohath, a number of unnamed sons stood between Amram
    and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    Moses wrote his older brother's genealogy in Exodus six. He knew who their
    parents were and most likely every forefather back to Levi. But he did not
    name them all. There was no need. An abbreviated list adequately showed
    Aaron's roots and thus where he belonged in the organization of Israel. So,
    Moses named their forefather who was a grandson of Levi and their
    foremother who was a daughter of Levi. Amram and Jochebed were highly
    visible ancestors among Jacob's descendants. That connection made Moses and
    Aaron legitimate descendants of noted stock in Israel. Their lineage was
    beyond any challenge.
</p>
<p>
    No one disputes that relational words are used in the Bible in a general
    sense such as "the sons of Israel" where all the descendants of Jacob are
    called "sons." But it is less well known that they are also used widely in
    a broad sense when individuals are spoken of. Such misunderstanding leads
    to grave misinterpretations of Scripture. Thus, there is a great need to
    see numerous examples of this use of relational words.
</p>
<p>
    The following section provides such examples. While those familiar with the
    Bible will immediately understand many of the examples, explanation is
    given so that all may understand. First a simple example is given of each
    relational category used in a broad sense; then more complex examples are
    provided. Further insights will be developed as examples are explored.
</p>
<h3>
    Example of Each Kinship Term Used in a Broad Sense
</h3>
<p>
    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u>.</strong>
Use of the Hebrew verb <em>beget/bear</em> (YLD) in a broad sense:    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Jochebed bore [YLD} to Amram Aaron and Moses and Miriam. Numbers 26:59.
</p>
<p>
    The three children Jochebed bore to Amram were actually descendants born
    eight to twelve generations later. The Hebrew concept was that all
    descendants were in the loins of their forefathers. Statements of specific
    acts such as "to begat/to bear" are used accurately and literally to
    describe such distant relationships.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>
    used for both a father and grandfather in the same verse:
</p>
<p>
    And David said to him, "Do not fear, for I will show you [Mephibosheth]
    kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and I will restore to you
    all the land of Saul your father, and you shall eat at my table always." II
    Samuel 9:7.
</p>
<p>
    Mephibosheth was the son of David's dear friend Jonathan and the grandson
    of Saul, the first king of Israel. Yet David calls both men Mephibosheth's
    father, showing how Hebrews easily used the term "father" for immediate and
    more distant direct forefathers.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Mother.</u></strong>
    Use of the concept of <em>mother</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        He [Asa] also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother&#8230;.
        I Kings 15:13.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Maacah was the mother of King Asa's father and the grandmother of King Asa.
    However, of all the various filial terms, "mother" is seldom used broadly.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    . Use of the noun <em>son</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    [Jacob asked,] "Do you know Laban, son of Nahor?" Genesis 29:5.
</p>
<p>
    Actually, Laban was the son of Bethuel and grandson of Nahor. Most likely
    Jacob mentioned Nahor rather than Bethuel because Nahor was the forefather
    of many people in the area and would be well known. In case the shepherds
    did not know Laban, they could at least point Jacob in the right direction
    to where Nahor's people lived.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Daughter</u>.</strong>
    Use of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    But Naomi said, "Turn back my daughters, why will you go with me?" Ruth
    1:11.
</p>
<p>
    Naomi was speaking to her two daughters-in-law. They were not her children.
    This is the use of daughter in a wider sense than being the mother of these
    two women.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Brother/Sister</u></strong>
    . Use of the nouns <em>brother</em> and <em>sister</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    Say to your brothers, 'You are my people,' and to your sisters, 'You have
    received mercy.'" Hosea 2:1.
</p>
<p>
    In the anticipation of fulfilled prophecy, Hosea foresaw that the people
    would call the men of the nation <em>brothers</em> and the women of the
nation <em>sisters</em>. This is the same type of broad sense of    <em>sister</em> as is found in Sons of Israel using <em>son</em> in a broad
    sense.
</p>
<p>
    The above verses illustrate seven relational concepts used in a broad sense
in biblical Hebrew-<em>to beget/to bear, father, mother, son, daughter, brother</em> and    <em>sister</em>. Next we will examine more complex examples of the broad
    use of these relational words.
</p>
<h3>
    Examples with More Complexity
</h3>
<p>
    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>
    (YLD). This common Hebrew verb is used for a mother's bearing of both a
    son, four grandchildren and even a granddaughter.
</p>
<p>
    <sup>17</sup>
The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, with Serah their sister.    <sup>18</sup>These are the sons of Zilpah, &#8230;and these she bore to
    Jacob. Genesis 46:17-18.
</p>
<p>
    The list of Jacob's family going down to Egypt is arranged according to his
    four wives. Asher was a son of Jacob sired through Zilpah, Leah's handmaid.
    The list names four sons and a daughter for Asher but then summarizes by
    saying Zilpah bore these children to Jacob when actually the only child
    born by Zilpah in this list was Asher. The passage also calls all five
    grandchildren sons when one was a granddaughter.
</p>
<p>
    The idea of bearing a child who is actually a grandchild or more distant
    descendant is foreign to western thinking and therefore shocking to modern
    readers. Our first such example was that of Amram and Jochebed begetting
    Miriam, Aaron and Moses. Here is a second instance of bearing referring to
    someone other than an immediate offspring.
</p>
<p>
    While this broad use of the concept of "to bear, to beget" is unfamiliar to
    most, Hebrew language scholars such as noted scholar and commentator C.F.
    Keil acknowledged it many years ago. He wrote of the high priestly line of
    Aaron, "[YLD, the Hebrew word for "beget/bear] in the genealogical lists
    may express mediate [in contrast to immediate] procreation, and the
grandson may be introduced as begotten by the grandfather."    <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>To Beget/To Bear</u></strong>
    -other examples: Deuteronomy 4:25 and Isaiah 39:7 quoted in II Kings 20:18
    (speaks of sons born to Hezekiah but these sons were born generations
    later, not the immediate sons born to him or even his grandsons or great
    grandsons).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father.</u></strong>
    Use of the noun <em>father</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    You shall&#8230;[say], "A wandering Aramean was my father. And he went down
    into Egypt and sojourned there, few in number, and there he became a
    nation, great, mighty, and populous." Deuteronomy 26:5.
</p>
<p>
    Moses was speaking of Jacob when he told the 2.5 million people who lived
    half a millennium after Jacob to say "A wandering Aramean was my father."
    He was teaching the Israelites to be humble about their roots, that it was
    God and not their forefather who was the source of all their blessings,
    making them a nation and giving them the Promised Land. In the broad sense
    of the word "father," every descendant of Jacob could call him "father."
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>
    used for the ancestor of various later descendants:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>3</sup>
        The LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the earlier ways of
        his <u>father</u> David; <sup>2</sup>[Hezekiah] did what was right in
        the eyes of the LORD, according to all that David his <u>father</u> had
done; <sup>7</sup>Do not be like your <u>fathers</u>&#8230;.        <sup>8</sup>Do not now be stiff-necked as your <u>fathers</u>
        were&#8230;. II Chron. 17:3; 29:2; 30:7-8. (Underlining ours.)
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    David was the forefather of kings Jehoshaphat and Hezekiah who lived many
    generations later. Nevertheless, David is called their father. King
    Hezekiah urged his subjects to turn from the wicked deeds of their fathers
    which included generations of departure from the feasts prescribed in the
    Law of Moses. Four times the term "father" refers either in part or
    entirely to those who were separated by at least one generation from their
    immediate father.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>
    referring to the original patriarchs of the Jewish people:
</p>
<p>
    See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land
    that the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to
    give to them and to their offspring after them. Deuteronomy 1:8.
</p>
<p>
    Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause this people to inherit the
    land that I swore to their fathers to give them. Joshua 1:6.
</p>
<p>
    <sup>2</sup>
    Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Long ago, your fathers lived beyond
    the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and they served
    other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the
River&#8230;." <sup>14</sup>Put away the gods your fathers served&#8230;,    <sup>15</sup>Choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your
    fathers served in the region beyond the River&#8230;. Joshua 24:2-3, 14-15.
</p>
<p>
    In each of these three examples the people being spoken to are the
    generation that occupied the Promised Land. They are reminded that God had
    promised the land to the Patriarchs of Israel-Abraham, Isaac and Jacob who
    lived 500-600 years before-and their descendants. These Patriarchs are
    called the peoples' fathers. In the strict sense, a person can have only
    one father. Yet here even Abraham's idolatrous father Terah is called their
    father. Clearly "father" is used in the broad sense here. As in the case of
    "son" referring to the entire nation, no one questions this use of "father"
    as it occurs so frequently. Why then should it be surprising that "father"
    when applied to a single "son" could also be used in a broad sense?
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>
    used in a broad sense even for non-Jewish peoples:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>1</sup>
        King Belshazzar&#8230;. <sup>2</sup>Nebuchadnezzar his father&#8230;.
        Daniel 5:1-2.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Belshazzar was actually the son or son-in-law of Nabonidus who was the son
    of Nebuchadnezzar. Critics have used this verse to claim the Bible is in
    error. But obviously Daniel was using "father" in the typical Hebrew broad
    sense. Inerrancy-minded Christians are not the only ones who have not
    understood the Hebrew practice of using filial terms in a broad sense.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Father</u></strong>
    -further examples of the broad use: Genesis 31:3; Deuteronomy 1:8; II Kings
    18:3; 22:4; I Chronicles 24:19; II Chronicles 28:27, 29:2, 34:3; Nehemiah
    2:8.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    used for both an immediate son and a distant male descendant:
</p>
<p>
    And Shebuel the son of Gershom, son of Moses, was chief officer in charge
    of the treasuries. I Chronicles 26:24.
</p>
<p>
    While Gershom truly was the son of Moses, born about 1450 BC, Shebuel,
    treasury official of David, was born over 400 years later yet is said to be
    the son of Gershom.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    used for various generations after the father without distinction:
</p>
<p>
    The sons of Judah: Perez, Hezron, Carmi, Hur and Shobal. I Chron. 4:1.
</p>
<p>
    <a name="__DdeLink__6405_1562312202"></a>
    In this verse all five individuals are said to be sons of Judah, yet only
    one, Perez, was the immediate offspring of Judah. Hezron was a son of Perez
    and therefore a grandson of Judah. Perez's twin brother, Zerah, had a
    distant descendant name Carmi, the father of Achan who troubled Israel in
    the time of Joshua. Hur and Shobal were sons of Hezron and thus great
    grandsons of Judah. Yet all are listed as sons of Judah. Clearly, the term
    "son" was very flexible in Hebrew genealogies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    used for a specific distant descendant:
</p>
<p>
    And the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the
    Levites receive the tithes. Nehemiah 10:38.
</p>
<p>
    The priesthood in Israel came from just one of the many families of the
    tribe of Levi, the family of Aaron. Aaron, the founder of this family, was
    born around 1500 BC. This example comes from the time of Nehemiah, about
    500 BC where the priest is called "the son of Aaron." Obviously, the priest
    was a distant descendant of Aaron. The term "son" does not convey an
    immediate father-son relationship in Nehemiah 10:38.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of a distant descendant of a clan leader:
</p>
<p>
    And Joshua and all Israel with him took <u>Achan the son of Zerah</u>, and
    the silver and the cloak and the bar of gold&#8230;. Joshua 7:24.
    (Underlining ours.)
</p>
<p>
    When Israel defeated Jericho, a soldier named Achan from the tribe of Judah
    took booty God marked for destruction. In judgment Israel lost its next
    battle. "Joshua tore his clothes and fell to the earth on his face before
    the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel" (Joshua
    7:6). God said Israel had sinned; they had transgressed His covenant. The
    guilty party was to be found and executed. God gave three levels of search:
    tribe, clan and household. In the morning each tribe was to be presented.
    The tribe that was taken would come by clan. The clan that was taken would
    come by household. The household that was taken would come by individual
    soldier (Joshua 7:14-ESV).
</p>
<p>
    Joshua did as God commanded. When the tribes passed, Judah was taken. When
    the four clans of Judah passed, the clan of Zerah was taken. When the
    households of that clan passed, the household of Zabdi was taken.
    Eventually the soldier named Achan was taken. He confessed and was
    executed. Altogether the clans of Judah numbered 76,500 soldiers according
    to Numbers 26:22. Yet the passage calls Achan the son of Zerah even though
    he was just one of thousands of soldiers in that clan. The writer knew
    this. He did not make a mistake. He clearly gave the basic descent of
    Achan, beginning with his tribe, clan, and household as was the custom
    before skipping down to his father and him saying, "Achan, the son of
    Carmi, the son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken"
    (Joshua 7:18).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Son</u></strong>
    -other examples of the broad use: Exodus 12:35, 37 ("son" translated
    "people"); Numbers 26:5-40, 32:40, 41; Joshua 5:3, 17:6; II Samuel 9:9-10
    (twice); I Chronicles 6:44, 50; II Chronicles 29:12-14, 29:21, 31:19,
    35:14-15-3x; Ezra 2:1-14, 3:10; Nehemiah 10:39; 11:4-9, 22-24; 12:23, 47.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Daughter</u>.</strong>
    Use of the noun <em>daughter</em> in a broad sense:
</p>
<p>
    None of the daughters of Israel shall be a cult prostitute. Deuteronomy
    23:17.
</p>
<p>
    This verse goes on with "and none of the sons of Israel shall be a cult
    prostitute." Obviously the verse is using both terms in the broad sense of
    all the females and all the males who descended from Jacob.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Daughter </u></strong>
    used for a single distant descendant:
</p>
<p>
    The daughter of Caleb was Achsah. I Chronicles 2:49.
</p>
<p>
    Two prominent Calebs descended from Judah. One lived early in the Egyptian
    sojourn while the other lived during the conquest of Canaan, about 300
    years later. I Chronicles 2:42-50 lists descendants of the first Caleb, a
    celebrated great grandson of Judah. Last of all it lists Achsah as his
    daughter when actually she was a distant female ancestor, a granddaughter
    many times removed.
</p>
<p>
    Achsah is mentioned in this list because she was famous in the history of
    Israel. The second Caleb offered Achsah, his immediate daughter as a wife
    to the warrior who could capture the city of Debir. So Achsah was the
    immediate daughter of Caleb the spy who lived at the time of the conquest
    of Canaan, but a distant descendant of the first Caleb, the one in I Chron.
    2:49, who lived early in the Egyptian captivity.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Daughter</u></strong>
    -further examples of the broad sense: Genesis 24:48; 29:12; Joshua 17:6.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Brother</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of a close friend:
</p>
<p>
    I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan&#8230;. II Samuel 1:26.
</p>
<p>
    David in a eulogy to Jonathan calls him his brother. Actually, they were
    not even from the same tribe, let alone clan or household. This is a very
    broad use of the term <em>brother</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Brother</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of fellow male Jews:
</p>
<p>
    Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against
    their Jewish brothers. Nehemiah 5:1.
</p>
<p>
    After the return from Babylon a famine struck. Impoverished Jews exploited
    by wealthy Jews raised a great outcry. Nehemiah reasoned that the wealthy
    Jews should not exploit the impoverished Jews since all Jews were brothers.
    In the strict sense "brothers" are sons of the same immediate father, but
    in the broad sense all males who descended from Jacob were "brothers."
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u> Brother</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of uncle:
</p>
<p>
    <sup>3</sup>
    Now Zelophehad the son of Hepher&#8230; had no sons, but only [five]
    daughters. <sup>4</sup>[They said] "The Lord commanded Moses to give us an
    inheritance along with our brothers." So according to the mouth of the LORD
    he gave them an inheritance among the brothers of their father. Joshua
    17:3-4.
</p>
<p>
    Hepher had at least three sons. The one named Zelophehad had only
    daughters. His five daughters went to Moses (Numbers 27:1-10) requesting
    the inheritance of their father to memorialize his name in Israel. Moses
    inquired of the LORD and was told to establish a law to the effect that if
    a family only had daughters, for the sake of the man's name, his
    inheritance would go his daughters. In the verse they refer to their
    father's brothers as their brothers. In reality their father's brothers
    were their uncles. This is another example of brother in a broad sense
    beyond one's immediate male sibling.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Brother</u></strong>
    -further examples of the broad sense: Joshua 1:14-15; I Chronicles 6:39,
    44; II Chronicles 29:15, 34; 30:7; Nehemiah 3:1; 5:14; 11:8-9.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Sister</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of one intimately close to the speaker:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>My Sister, my bride. Song of Solomon 4:9, 10, 12; 5:1. </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Solomon used the term sister in the broad sense of the intimacy he felt
    towards his beloved. Clearly he would treat her as more than a sister.
Because this is figurative, it is somewhat of a borderline example of    <em>sister</em> in a broad sense but it is far more than the blood daughter
    of Solomon's mother.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Sister</u></strong>
    used in the broad sense of a female belonging to a particular people group:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        For they [the Midianites] have harassed you with their wiles, with
        which they beguiled you&#8230;in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of
        the chief of Midian, their sister&#8230;. Numbers 25:18.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Israel went to war with the Midianites because their women had led
    Israelite men away from God. The woman Cozbi is mentioned by name and
    called their sister even though in a narrow sense Cozbi could not be the
    sister of all the women of Midian.

    Unique Features of Hebrew Genealogies

<p>
    <strong><u>Unborn sons</u></strong>
    :
</p>
<p>
    <sup>5</sup>
    The sons of Israel carried Jacob their father, their little ones, and their
    wives, in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. <sup>6</sup>They
    also took their livestock and their goods, which they had gained in the
land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his offspring with him,    <sup>7</sup>his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his
sons' daughters. All his offspring he brought with him into Egypt.    <sup> 8</sup>Now these are the names of the descendants of Israel, who came
    into Egypt&#8230;. <sup>12</sup>The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez,
    and Zerah (but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan); and the sons of
    Perez were Hezron and Hamul. <sup>21</sup>And the sons of Benjamin: Bela,
Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppin, Huppin, and Ard.    <sup>26</sup>All the persons belonging to Jacob who came into Egypt, who
    were his own descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, were sixty-six
    persons in all. Genesis 46:5-8, 12, 21, 26.
</p>
<p>
    Genesis 46:7 states that Jacob "brought all his offspring with him into
    Egypt." Each offspring is named and counted. Yet some were not yet born.
    These unborn offspring could have been born up to 40 years after the move.
    They were grandsons and possibly even great grandsons. The list includes
    not only Perez but his two sons-Hezron and Hamul (Genesis 46:20). Since
    Perez himself was just born or maybe not yet quite born when they moved,
    his two sons would not be born until Jacob's family had been living in
    Egypt 20-30 years. We might think the writer was deceptive to include
    unborn children in the list, but that is because we are judging by the way
    we look at genealogies. What was important to God was to establish the
    forefathers of the sons of Israel in the minds of the Jewish people.
</p>
<p>
    Benjamin was born after Simeon and Levi massacred the men of Shechem. God
    told Jacob to move his family to Bethel. From there they moved to Isaac at
    Mamre (Hebron) and along the way, near Bethlehem, Rachel died giving birth
    to Benjamin. Twenty-four years later Jacob moved his family to Egypt, and
    in the Genesis 46:21 list of those who moved to Egypt are ten sons for
    Benjamin. While some may have been a scribal error, the rest most likely
    were still in the loins of their father. We must conclude that some were
    Benjamin's grandsons, even though they are found in that list of Jacob's
    offspring that he took to Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    Naming and counting unborn children seems strange to us until we realize
    that the primary purpose of the genealogies was to bind a nation together
    by blood. Genealogies identified the members of the nation and gave them a
    powerful glue that is the marvel of the world to this day. No other nation
    ceased to exist for two millennia and then came back to life as Israel did
    in 1948. Naming both born and unborn descendants provided a registry from
    which the clans of Israel developed. Apparently, it was important to have a
    foundation of names in the registry from the beginning of the sojourn in
    Egypt. Only God could devise a system that would last nearly four
    millennia.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Undercounting of daughters</u></strong>
    :
</p>
<p>
    The passage says Jacob took "his daughters" to Egypt. Yet only one
    immediate daughter, Dinah, is listed and counted in the offspring total of
    66. On the other hand, neither Jacob's four wives nor any of his sons'
    wives and only one granddaughter are counted in the family total of 70 that
    ended up in Egypt. Stephen has been faulted for saying that "Joseph sent
    and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in
    all" (Acts 7:14). Since the party included his four wives, his unnamed
    daughters and his sons' unnamed daughters, who is to condemn some Rabbi
    whose Bible study Stephen attended who counted Jacob's party using
    different criteria and found the total to be 75, not the 66 number of
    Genesis 46:26?
</p>

        <sup>17</sup>
        So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre,
        the field with the cave&#8230;was made over <sup>18</sup>to Abraham as
        a possession in the presence of the Hittites... Genesis 23:17-18.

        They were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had

    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Abraham purchased the field of Machpelah with its double cave where the
    three patriarchs and their wives were buried whereas Jacob purchased the
    land in Shechem where Joseph was buried. So, it was Jacob, not Abraham who
    purchased the field in Shechem. Stephen's words in Acts 7:16 appears to be
    a direct contradiction of these facts except for the Hebrew practice of
    associating ancestors with the actions of their descendants. In effect,
through Jacob Abraham purchased the Shechem property.    <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="">[3]</a>

<h3>
    Complete Genealogies
</h3>
<p>
    Before examining many abbreviated or condensed genealogies, let's examine
    two apparently complete genealogies. From the tribe of Judah is Jerahmeel's
    list of twenty-three generations beginning with Perez and ending sometime
    in the Period of the Judges. Judah raised two successive families. The
    second was by his Canaanite daughter-in-law Tamar who bore him the twins,
    Zerah and Perez. The only noted descendant of Zerah was Achan, the trouble
    maker of Israel. But many famous descendants came from the other twin,
    Perez, including King David, Caleb the believing spy, Bezelel who was the
    chief artisan on the Tabernacle and the Lord Jesus Christ. Perez also had
    two sons, Hezron and Hamul. The famous people mentioned above all came
    through Hezron who fathered three sons: Jerahmeel, Ram and Chelubai
    (Caleb). Jerahmeel's list records 23 consecutive generations extending from
    the beginning of the Egyptian sojourn until about 200 years before David.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Jerahmeel</u> </strong>
    (23 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):
</p>
<p>
    <sup>25</sup>
    [Perez-1; Hezron-2] The sons of Jerahmeel [3], the firstborn of
    Hezron&#8230;. <sup>26</sup>Jerameel also had another wife, whose name was
    Atarah; she was the mother of Onam [4]. <sup>28</sup>The sons of Onam:
Shammai [5] and Jada. The sons of Shammai: Nadab [6] and Abishur.    <sup>30</sup>The sons of Nadab: Seled and Appaim [7]. <sup>31</sup>The son
    of Appaim: Ishi [8]. The son of Ishi: Sheshan [9]. The son of Sheshan:
    Ahlai [10-actually Ahlai is Sheshan's daughter]. <sup>34</sup>Now Sheshan
    had no sons, only daughters, but Sheshan had an Egyptian slave whose name
    was Jarha. <sup>35</sup>So Sheshan gave his daughter in marriage to Jarha
    his slave, and she bore him Attai [11]. <sup>36</sup>Attai fathered Nathan
    [12], and Nathan fathered Zabad [13]. <sup>37</sup>Zabad fathered Ephlal
    [14], and Ephlal fathered Obed [15]. <sup>38</sup>Obed fathered Jehu [16],
    and Jehu fathered Azariah [17]. <sup>39</sup>Azariah fathered Helez [18],
    and Helez fathered Eleasah [19]. <sup>40</sup>Eleasah fathered Sismai [20],
    and Sismai fathered Shallum [21]. <sup>41</sup>Shallum fathered Jekamiah
    [22], and Jekamiah fathered Elishama [23]. I Chron. 2:25-26, 31, 34-37,
    39-41.
</p>
<p>
    Although Jerahmeel had no significant descendants, no less than seventeen
    verses of Scripture are devoted to them. Why? He was Hezron's firstborn.
    Time and again the firstborn is featured in the Old Testament merely
    because he was the firstborn. Apparently because so many famous people came
    from Hezron, the historian felt obligated to give all the information he
    had on Hezron's firstborn even though he had no famous descendants.
</p>
<p>
    Jerahmeel's longest string has 23 descendants, finally concluding well into
    the period of the Judges. By comparison, the line of Ram, Hezron's second
    eldest, reaches all the way from Perez to King David with just ten names.
    Because Jerahmeel's line ends somewhere in the middle of the Judges, about
    eight more names would need to be added to reach to David's birth. Clearly,
    many individuals are left out in the Perez-Ram-David line which will be
    examined in the next chapter.
</p>
<p>
    About 40 names are found in Jerahmeel's listing (I Chronicles 2:25-41).
    Because it takes some doing to separate out the 23 generations that appear
    to be continuous, the following commentary is provided. Jacob fathered
    Judah, his fourth son, who fathered Perez. Judah was about 45 years old
    when his father moved the family to Egypt (1876 BC). Perez could not have
    been born much before this date since he and his twin brother Zerah were
    born after Judah had grown from birth in Haran to adulthood in Shechem, had
    fathered three sons who also grew to adulthood and two had died by the
    judgment of God, all in those 45 years. Thus, the birth of Tamar's twins,
    Zerah and Perez, had to have occurred very close to the move to Egypt. For
    sake of convenience, HB reckons their birth to be in the year of the move,
    i.e., 1876 BC. This starts the generational count not only of Jerahmeel's
    line, but also that of Perez's other lines leading to Caleb, David, Bezelel
    and Christ. For convenience the 23 generations are listed below without
    verse notations:
</p>
<p>
    1-Perez; 2-Hezron; 3-Jerahmeel; 4-Onam; 5-Shammai; 6-Nadab; 7-Appaim;
    8-Ishi; 9-Sheshan who had no sons, only daughters, one of whom he gave to
    his Egyptian slave Jarha; 10-Ahlai, daughter of Sheshan first called his
    son then explained that she was really his daughter but that he had no
    sons; 11-Attai; 12-Nathan; 13-Zabad; 14-Ephlal; 15-Obed; 16-Jehu (whom we
    suggest was in the Exodus generation); 17-Azariah; 18-Helez; 19-Eleasah;
    20-Sismai; 21-Shallum; 22-Jekamiah; 23-Elishama. I Chronicles 2:25-41.
</p>
<p>
    Most lists have difficulties and Jerahmeel's is no exception. The greatest
    difficulty here is determining when it ends historically. Scripturally, the
    list ends with "and Jekamiah fathered Elishama" (I Chronicles 2:41) before
    moving on to "The sons of Caleb the younger brother of Jerahmeel&#8230;" in
    the next verse. Does this list extend through the Judges or even through
    the kings to the Captivity? The text doesn't say.
</p>
<p>
    One observation is that the genealogies coming at the beginning of
    Chronicles seem to focus on Israel's earlier history. The strongest clue is
    that of the ninth name, Sheshan. He had an Egyptian slave whom he gave to
    his daughter to carry on his name since he had no sons. A Hebrew owning an
    Egyptian slave? When during the 430-year Egyptian sojourn might the
    Israelites have been so prosperous and free as to own slaves who were
    Egyptian in nationality before the Hebrews themselves were reduced to
    slavery? It needed to be during a time when they enjoyed much freedom and
    especially before they became so numerous as to be a threat to Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    During the years of famine Joseph managed the transfer of the land to
    Pharaoh, thereby greatly strengthening Pharaoh's office. Pharaoh showed his
    gratitude by favoring Joseph and his family with some of Egypt's best
    grazing land in the northeast of the Nile delta. Gradually Egypt declined
    and eventually the northern portion was overrun by the famous Hyksos
    people. They, like the Hebrews, were of Semitic stock. The Hyksos needed
    allies among the defeated Egyptians, so Israel most likely enjoyed a large
    amount of freedom under them. This would have been a favorable period for
    Sheshan to give his daughter Ahlai, who is called "his son" in verse 31, to
    his Egyptian slave Jarha. This marriage occurs in the tenth generation of
    Perez through Jerahmeel. At this point in history, we estimate that new
    generations were beginning about every 28 years so the daughter Ahlai would
    have been born about 280 years into the Egyptian sojourn or 150 years
    before the Exodus.
</p>
<p>
    Sometime later stronger Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty arose who drove
    out the Hyksos. At that point the Hebrews would have been deemed a threat
    so they were put to servitude. Shortly thereafter Princess Hatshepsut,
    daughter of Thutmose I, found and adopted Moses. Hatshepsut went on to
    control or rule Egypt for nearly a quarter of a century, first on behalf of
    her sickly husband, Thutmose II, and then on behalf of his infant son,
    Thutmose III, borne by a court woman. Thutmose III is said to have been
    about twenty-two when his step-mother died and for the next 30 years he
    ruled Egypt in his own right. He proved to be a powerful Pharaoh who
    extended the rule of Egypt all the way to the Euphrates.
</p>
<p>
    At the age of 40 Moses had to flee when he killed the Egyptian because
    Thutmose III would use this crime as a way of removing his rival Moses. Dr.
    Merrill points out that this Pharaoh is the only one to rule Egypt for
    forty years until Ramses II who ruled 200 years later and therefore the
    only Pharaoh to fit the timeline of Moses during a considerable stretch of
    Egyptian history.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title="">[4]</a> God kept
    Moses in the wilderness forty years until the next pharaoh, Amenhotep II,
    succeeded Thutmose III.
</p>
<p>
    Returning to our timeline, if Sheshan's slave is correctly dated, the 16th
    generation of Jerahmeel would be the generation that left Egypt in the
    Exodus. That leaves the final seven generations for the first half of the
    480 period from the Exodus until Solomon's Temple. Thus, Jarehmeel's line
    falls about ten generations short of Solomon's reign or nine of David's.
    Dr. Keil generally supports this view, being of the opinion that
Jerahmeel's line ended somewhere near the end of the period of the Judges.    <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="">[5]</a>
</p>
<p>
    In conclusion the line of Jerahmeel seems to indicate that about 33
    generations are involved in the time from the beginning of the Egyptian
    sojourn and the birth of Perez until the beginning of Solomon's reign.
    These 33 generations cover a period of some 906 years (1876-970=906).

    <strong><u>Complete genealogy of Heman</u> </strong>
    (19 consecutive generations-numbering in brackets):
</p>
<p>
    <sup>31</sup>
    These are the men whom David put in charge of the service of song in the
    house of the LORD after the ark rested there. <sup>33</sup>Of the sons of
    the Kohathites: Heman [1] the singer the son of Joel [2], son of Samuel
    [3], <sup>34</sup>son of Elkanah [4], son of Jeroham [5], son of Eliel [6],
    son of Toah [7], <sup>35</sup>son of Zuph [8], son of Elkanah [9], son of
    Mahath [10], son of Amasai [11], <sup>36</sup>son of Elkanah [12], son of
    Joel [13], son of Azariah [14], son of Zephaniah [15], <sup>37</sup>son of
Tahath [16], son of Assir [17], son of Ebiasaph [18], son of Korah [19],    <sup>38</sup>son of Izhar, son of Kohath, son of Levi, son of Israel. I
    Chron. 6:31, 33-38.
</p>
<p>
    Our second example of a complete genealogy provides what the first did
    not-a precise ending point as well as a precise starting point. When Jacob
    took his family to Egypt, his third son Levi came with his three sons
    Gershon, Kohath and Merari. Eventually they multiplied into a large tribe.
    Each of the sons formed a clan. God gave the clans of Levi to assist Aaron
    for the ministry of the Tabernacle. Seven hundred years later Samuel and
    even later David organized the Levites for ministry. After bringing the Ark
    to Jerusalem David appointed one person from each clan to be a worship
    leader at the Tabernacle. In the center Heman was to lead the Kohathite
    singers. On his right Asaph would lead the Gershonite singers. On his left
    hand Ethan was to direct the Merari singers.
</p>
<p>
    To have had this heavy responsibility Heman needed to be a mature man at
    the time of his appointment. In fact, his own family all but filled the
    choir loft. I Chronicles 25:5 reports that God gave Heman fourteen sons and
    three daughters who were all under the direction of their father's musical
    work in the house of the LORD. Yet he not only served in David's day but
    lived to serve in Solomon's day as well. David brought the Ark to Jerusalem
    after his first seven years of rule in Hebron which began about 1010 BC. So
    Heman was maybe slightly older than David; 1000 BC is certainly a ballpark
    ending point for Heman's genealogy. But where did it begin? Actually it
    began with Jacob but what grabs our attention is the name Korah. Korah was
    the leader of the rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron and
    becomes the reason the story of Heman is so touching.
</p>
<p>
    The story begins shortly after that first year of law-giving in the
    wilderness so it could be dated to about 1444 BC. God strongly guarded both
    the spiritual things of Israel under Aaron and the civil authority under
    Moses. The severity of punishment for violating those institutions is well
    known. A well-meaning man steadied the Ark during transport and God struck
    him dead. Anyone without authorization within the tabernacle grounds was to
    be put to death. Levites of the clan of Kohath and sons of Reuben found 250
    princes of Israel to join them to challenge the authority of Moses and
    Aaron and God struck them all dead (Numbers 16). The camp took the side of
    those slain so God sent a plague that consumed thousands. Only the
    intercession of Moses and Aaron stopped the plague. Eighteen generations
    later a descendant of this wicked man Korah became worship leader of the
    entire nation. What a story of mercy and grace.
</p>
<p>
    The dates are known: the rebellion of Korah about 1444 BC and the Ark
    carried to Jerusalem about 1000 BC, a time span of nearly 450 years. The
    number of generations identified in the Heman list for this period is 19.
    But Aaron and Korah were in their 80's while David and Heman were in their
    40's, so one generation must be subtracted from Heman's list. That leaves
    18 names. In counting the time from one generation to the next, begin
    counting with the second person. That leaves 17 names or 26.5 years per
    generation which is well in the ballpark for generations.
</p>
<p>
    Now we must return to David's list which will be discussed in chapter
    seven. It is found four times in the Bible, beginning with Ruth 4:18-22.
    That list gives ten names starting with the move to Egypt in 1876 BC. The
    first three names are those who lived at the beginning of the 430-years in
    Egypt-Perez, Hezron and Ram. Then it skips down 300 years to the time of
    the Exodus with three more names: Amminadab, Nahshon and Salmon. Amminadab
    was the elderly patriarch of Judah. His son, Nahshon was the Prince of
    Judah whom Moses asked to conduct the second census for Judah. Salmon
    married Rahab after the fall of Jericho. From that point to David is 400
    years yet only four names remain in David's genealogy-Boaz, Obed, Jesse and
    David. If there were no omitted generations, that list would represent 100
    years per generation. The Heman list not only shows us what a complete
    genealogy would look like from the Exodus to the time of worship in
    Jerusalem but it also shows that the David list is abbreviated.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, the Heman list omits 8-12 generations during the Egyptian sojourn
    just like the Aaron list did. After beginning with Jacob, it lists
    Levi-Kohath-Izhar-Korah. Aaron's list follows the same pattern:
    Levi-Kohath-Amram-Aaron. The first three names in each list are
    consecutive. The difference comes with Kohath's sons. Aaron descended from
    Amram, the first of Kohath's sons while Korah descended from Izhar, the
    second of Kohath's four sons. Kohath and his sons Amram and Izhar lived at
    the beginning of the sojourn in Egypt. Aaron and Korah were born 300 years
    later near the end of the Egyptian sojourn. The Heman list follows the
    pattern of Aaron's list and therefore confirms Aaron's list by skipping
    8-12 generations between Izhar and Korah just like the Aaron list skipped
    8-12 generations between Amram and Aaron.
</p>
<p>
    Heman's list is ascending, moving back through time from son to father. We
    will reverse it to view it the usual way (descending from father to son).
    We have removed Heman's three forefathers (Levi-Kohath-Izhar) which we just
    covered above:
</p>
<p>
    1-Korah; 2-Ebiasaph; 3-Assir; 4-Tahath; 5-Zephaniah; 6-Azariah; 7-Joel;
    8-Elkanah; 9-Amasai; 10-Mahath; 11-Elkanah; 12-Zuph; 13-Toah; 14-Eliel;
    15-Jeroham; 16-Elkanah; 17-Samuel; 18-Joel; 19-Heman.
</p>
<p>
    Defenders of the 215-year view see such numbers and are forced to devise a
    scheme that harmonizes the numbers, oblivious to the nature and purpose of
    Hebrew genealogies. For example, one book says that Judah's first two sons
    had children when they were 14 or 15 years old and Judah's twins, Zerah and
    Perez, likewise had sons when they were still teenagers. Then to bridge the
    huge time span from that son to Bezalel, it suggests that each of the next
    fathers, Hezron, Caleb and Hur had their firstborns when they were in their
    sixties. Then to bridge the next brief time span, with a straight face this
    interpreter says the next generations had their sons when they were 20
    years old. The Korah-Heman list assures us that the Hebrew generations
    during those centuries were within the range of reason, in this case
    averaging 26 years per generation.
</p>
<p>
    Along the line of developing a story to fit misinterpreted numbers, another
    writer explained how four generations produced the six hundred thousand men
    found in the first census after the Exodus. The writer said it was simple.
    Each father had many sons, an average of like six sons per father per
    generation. In contrast with this speculation the record tells a different
    story. For every male that had six or more sons there was one that died
    early or didn't even marry or didn't have children or had just one or two
    sons.
</p>
<p>
    The other two lines of temple musicians are listed in I Chronicles 6 as
    well. However, they do not provide the same measure of certainty as the
    line of Heman. His line parallels Aaron's line for both his and Aaron's
    line give the first three generations living in Egypt, then skip down to
    the individual in their line who was an older adult at the time of the
    Exodus-Aaron and Korah. But in the case of Asaph and Ethan, we cannot
    identify the individual in their line who was contemporary with Aaron and
    Korah and thus their lines have no clear starting point. Both Ethan's and
    Asaph's lines become suspect to abbreviation.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <u>
            In summary this chapter uncovered the following characteristics of
            Hebrew lines:
        </u>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    1. The biblical genealogies are elegant, profound, mysterious, practical,
    personal and flexible in nature.
</p>
<p>
    2. Genealogies told the Hebrew who he was and where he belonged. They were
    a major element in organizing Israel both in the wilderness camp and in
    settling Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    3. The simplicity of Hebrew names requires great care in tracing lists. For
    the most part only a single name is given for an individual though several
    different names might be used for the same individual in different places.
    Some names were very popular so many people were known by the same name.
    People were given the names of famous ancestors. (In the translation to
    English it is sometimes even hard to tell if a name is male or female.)
</p>
<p>
    4. Biblical Hebrew contains only basic relational terms such as father,
    son, daughter, brother and beget. The same word could be used for immediate
    connections such as a father and his immediate son or more distant
    connections from ancestor to descendant or from descendant to ancestor.
</p>
<p>
    5. When the biblical text is read these elements appear in all their
    complexity. The company of people who moved to Egypt included the names of
    unborn sons. A daughter is even called a son. In the same verse a man is
    called the son of both his father and grandfather. I Chronicles 4:1 speaks
    of the sons of Judah then gives five names-one was a son, one was a
    grandson, two were great grandsons and one was a descendant who lived 400
    years later.
</p>
<p>
    6. Scripture provides two apparently complete and lengthy lists-those of
    Jerahmeel and Heman. When David's list is compared with those lists, it is
    found to be greatly abbreviated. For instance, during the same time frame
    that Jerahmeel's list contains twenty-three names and Heman's list contains
    19 names, David's list contains six names. These comparisons help us to see
    that David's genealogy is greatly condensed. Our next chapter will present
    14 examples of abbreviated genealogies including several already
    introduced. The chapter after that will address the most contentious of all
    genealogies, that of Shem.
</p>
<p>
    7. All these examples were correct uses of the Hebrew in the day they were
    recorded. They all reflect the inerrancy and infallibility of Scripture.
    However, they require that the student of Scripture be sensitive to the
    language in which Scripture was written and understand these lists in terms
    of the language of that day, not the language of our day.
