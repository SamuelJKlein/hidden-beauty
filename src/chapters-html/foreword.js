    (Yet to be written- OT Hebrew Authority Needed)
</p>
<p>
    As of April 2022 none of the world's leading inerrancy Hebrew/Old Testament
    scholars has agreed to review this book. Maybe they are too busy; maybe
    this issue is not that important; maybe it is too unique. But this does not
    mean that competent scholars with doctors' degrees have not reviewed this
    material. The author has communicated with three who have encouraged the
    publishing of these ideas. All three are senior scholars at or near the end
    of fruitful lifetime ministries in teaching the Old Testament.
</p>
<p>
    In contrast those who reject the idea that Shem's list is incomplete do not
    have this kind of experience or even these skills. Chapter 17 explains the
    difference between true scholars and those who add Shem's numbers to
    declare the date of the Flood. Some of the latter have corresponded
    personally with me. Their explanations and arguments are unconvincing and
    without merit. For the sake of unity in the Body of Christ I will not
    identify them. Love among the brethren is the greater requirement.
</p>
<p>
    The true issue of this book is the practice of Scripture. Is it true that
    it uses family terms in a broad sense as well as in the standard narrow
    sense? Is it true that the details of Amram and Jochebed were true of the
    parents of their unnamed immediate descendant and that the Hebrew verb "to
    bear" refers to bearing Miriam, Aaron and Moses in the broad sense of being
    born somewhere down the line? Is it true that there is a 61% decrease in
    longevity between Eber and Peleg and other than this enormous decrease, the
    average generational decrease was as high as six or seven years and
    eventually declined to zero by the end of Moses life? These biblical uses
    are clear and they are the point of this book. Thus, the Flood occurred
    nearer 4000 B.C. than 2500 B.C.
</p>
<p>
    Maybe someday the needed Old Testament Hebrew authority will come forward.

    Meanwhile, a tribute to many who have contributed ideas to this book. In a
    sense the author of <em>HB</em> is a compiler. He has taken the ideas of
    numerous creationists and other inerrancy believers and stitched them
    together to build this case for omitted generations in Shem's list. Among
    these we should salute the outstanding ideas found in HB from Merrill F.
    Unger, John Whitcomb, Henry Morris II, Bernard E. Northrup, Col. R. B.
    Thieme, Jr. (military strategy in Genesis 14), Walt Brown, John
    Baumgardner, Larry Vardiman and John Sanford. Without their original
    insights this book could not have been written as it stands. (To be
    developed under "Acknowledgments" at a later date.)
