    <strong>Abraham's Witness to a 430-Year Egyptian Sojourn</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The previous chapter observed that of the four witnesses only the words of
    the Apostle Paul in Galatians 3:17 can reasonably be made to support a
    215-year Egyptian sojourn. For his words to have this meaning, God's call
    had to come when Abraham was living in Haran, a position that is fatally
    flawed. Such an idea comes both from misinterpreting the Scriptural record
    of certain events and oversimplifying how God was preparing Abraham for a
    life of faith. Yet the subject is complex and is not settled with a few
    simple proof texts.
</p>
<p>
    This chapter begins by noting the many contributions to Abraham's total
    life story in those first 75 years overlooked by Ussher and his followers.
    In the process most readers will gain an entirely new appreciation for this
    one whom God used to found the Jewish people and birth our Savior. Those
    years were not unlike the early years of Moses, Paul, Joseph and David
    whose stops and starts laid groundworks for their future ministries.
    Understanding these puts flesh on the bones of Abraham's life of growing
    faith. Although sinning and doubting along the way, this man who worshipped
    idols in Ur with his kindred, (Joshua 24:2) came to build altars to the one
    and only true God in Haran so that when he arrived in Canaan his first
    response was to build an altar (Genesis 12:7-8). How did that happen?
</p>
<p>
    When the call came in Ur, even Abraham's idolatrous father must have been
    awed by his son's claims that if he followed the true God's leading, God
    would make of him a great nation and in him all the families of the earth
    would be blessed (Genesis 12:2-3). Apparently once Terah realized that he
    could not talk his son out of this insane plan to walk away from his life
    in Ur, he began to wonder if maybe God did appear to him after all. Terah
    had taken delight in his son's impressive achievements in Ur and had the
    strongest confidence in this only son still in his household. In the end,
    with his final years looming, his only option was to accompany his son
    although some of this remains a mystery. We can only surmise but history
    points to difficult times ahead for Ur. God often uses circumstances in His
    leading. Perhaps in this case the winds of war were already in the air.
    Whew, away from that!
</p>
<p>
    Along the journey the family most likely questioned Abraham: what next? God
    had said "to go to the land that I will show you" (Genesis 12:1). Hebrews
    11:8 concurs:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he
        was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he
        was going.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    In a way not explained by Scripture God was showing Abraham where to go
    just as He had said. At each fork somehow God led him. As they journeyed
    from Ur Abraham confidently told his party whether to go left, right or
    straight ahead. Because this went on for nearly two months Abraham's party
    must have felt better and better about the move with each passing day. Then
    suddenly about 700 miles from Ur Abraham didn't know which way to go.
    Whatever method God used to lead him stopped, vanished, disappeared into
    thin air. So there they waited and waited. Not a sign, not a hint from God.
    Finally, after some days, heavy with disappointment, they began to discuss
    what went wrong. Abraham knew-while he had separated from his country and
    relatives, he had not separated from his father's idolatrous household. Now
    what?
</p>
<p>
    The decision was made to settle in Haran. Scripture doesn't tell how far
    Haran was from where the leading stopped but it does report that "when they
    came to Haran, they settled there" (Genesis 11:31) even though they
    eventually learned that the destination was Canaan. After all this divine
    leading and the visitation that triggered it, Abraham would never be the
    same. Now he knew there was a great difference between the idolatrous gods
    of Ur and the true God who spoke to him in Ur and led him as far as Haran.
    He must know this true God. Information was available to those so motivated
    and Abraham began to gather that information and seek this God. With the
    passing of time he began to worship this true God. He began to build altars
    as those before him who worshipped the true God had done.
</p>
<p>
    For the next 10 or 15 years Abraham got to know the true God better and
    better and worshiped at the altar more and more frequently. This in itself
    is remarkable but another remarkable thing began to happen. The members of
    Terah's household began joining Abraham at the altar. Eventually,
    apparently Terah's entire household worshiped at the altar. He was in his
    final days and now totally dependent on his son. Very possibly before the
    end he also joined with the others at Abraham's altar. Oh, how marvelous
    was the grace of God in allowing this family situation to play out in Haran
    over those years.
</p>
<p>
    The proof for all this is the large evidence of faith demonstrated by
    Abraham's household once they reached Canaan-immediately worshipping at
    altars upon arrival, ascribing faith to Lot (II Peter 2:7), choosing for
    Hebron and the suicidal mission of rescuing Lot from the invasion of the
    Mesopotamian armies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Abraham's Place in the Birth Order of Terah's Sons</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Piecing together those 75 years before the move to Canaan requires solving
    the issue of birth order of Terah's three sons. Stephen said that Abraham
    moved to Canaan after Terah died (Acts 7:4). He died at the age of 205
    (Genesis 11:32). Since Abraham arrived in Canaan at the age of 75 (Genesis
    12:4), he was born when Terah was 130 years old (205-75=130). Because Terah
    began fathering his three sons when he was 70, Abraham had a brother who
    was 60 years his senior (130-70=60).
</p>
<p>
    But Abraham is generally considered the oldest son. Twice Scripture names
    Terah's three sons and in both cases the order is Abraham, Nahor and Haran
    (Genesis 11:26, 27). People assume the sons are named in the order of their
    birth. While this is the normal practice of Scripture, sometimes it names
    sons in the order of their importance or impact in the plan of God. Such is
    the case here. Abraham would touch the entire world. Nahor would supply
    wives to Abraham's descendants. Haran died in relative obscurity. As to why
    the three brothers were born over a period of 60 years, Terah apparently
    had a fertility problem. This explanation seems reasonable because his
    daughter Sarah was barren, his granddaughter Rebekah also was barren and
    even his great-granddaughter Rachel was barren.
</p>
<p>
    As to the ages of Abraham's two brothers, Nahor and Haran, Scripture
    provides important hints to work with. First, Nahor married Haran's
    daughter Milcah. Second, Haran's name suggests Terah enjoyed business
    success at the trade route town by that name before moving to Ur. Third,
    Haran died before Abraham left Ur. These three details point to Haran being
    older than Nahor. When was Nahor born? He had eight sons by Haran's
    daughter and was no longer living with his father when God called Abraham.
    Further Abraham was attached to Lot, the son of Haran, not his brother
    Nahor. These details indicate Nahor would have been 30 or 40 years older
    than Abraham. Now a possible picture emerges: Haran was born when Terah was
    70. Nahor was born 20-40 years later. Abraham was the youngest brother,
    born 60 years after Haran.
</p>
<p>
    More details emerge. Abraham married his father's daughter by a second
    wife. Sarah was ten years younger than Abraham. They were married long
    enough in Ur to discover that unlike her sister-in-law, she was barren.
    This seems to indicate that Abraham lived many adult years in Ur. The age
    for adulthood was 25 at the time. Possibly Abraham married Sarah once she
    reached that age. Then, 25-30 years of marriage would be adequate to
    realize that Sarah could not have children and would place the call of God
    when Abraham was 60 or 65. If so, Haran died by the age of 130 or 135 and
    Terah was 190 or 195. Living 35-40 adult years in Ur allowed Abraham to
    learn and achieve much and drink deeply from Ur's culture while 10-15 years
    of mature adult life in Haran would have been enough time to become wealthy
    both materially and spiritually.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Nephew Older Than Uncle</strong>
</p>
<p>
    With Lot's father 60 years older than Abraham and Lot's sister marrying
    Abraham's other brother, Lot himself must have been some years older than
    Abraham. Does this fit the context? Actually, Lot being older than Abraham
    makes better sense of what Scripture reveals of their relationship. One
    gets the impression that Abraham was more attached to Lot than Lot was to
    Abraham which would be expected if Lot were older than Abraham.
</p>
<p>
    Abraham's real older brother, Nahor, was preoccupied with a growing family.
    Meanwhile Lot continued to live in the household of his grandfather. So
    Lot, not Nahor, became the "big brother" figure in Abraham's life. This
    bonding would be a new explanation for why Abraham was so loyal to him and
    would also explain why Abraham offered Lot first choice of the land when
    they separated (Genesis 13). It would further explain how Lot could go his
    separate way and seek out Sodom rather than staying close to Abraham. He
    thought for himself. He had his own views. He did what he pleased. In
    summary, if Lot were the elder, he would have been something of a big
    brother in Abraham's childhood and this early relationship colored
    Abraham's relationship with him in adulthood.
</p>
<p>
    As to Terah, he was becoming infirm and dependent on others. His oldest son
    was dead and the other was living on his own. Abraham was the only son left
    to care for him when God's call came. As it played out, this youngest son
    and his daughter cared for Terah until his death. These also became the
    obvious heirs to Terah's household along with Lot who must have received an
    inheritance in place of his father who was the oldest son. This would also
    explain where Lot got the vast herds that forced him and Abraham to
    separate shortly after arriving in Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Life in Ur</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Of all the cities on the face of the earth in which to live in Abraham's
    day, Ur would have won top honors. It was the Paris of its time, even more
    advanced than any city in Egypt, leading in wealth, education, security,
    comfort and pleasure. Standing at the head of the Persian Gulf, it
    controlled the mouth of the Euphrates. Thousands of tablets have been
    recovered from the site that reflect this period. Numerous royal graves
    were found unrobbed and filled with historical artifacts. The temple
    complex housed a school. Sir Leonard Woolley excavated the levels of Ur
    from 1922-1934 and learned from student work tablets the extensive
    knowledge taught its youth, even high school level math. Consequently, the
    free population was both intelligent and well educated. The monarchy and
    the worship of the moon god were unifying institutions.
</p>
<p>
    Archaeologists report that most of Ur's population consisted of
    servants/slaves. If 90% were not completely free and the country's total
    population numbered 250,000, then only 25,000 were actual citizens.
    Abraham's kin could have numbered in the hundreds and wielded a significant
    influence within the free population. About Abraham's time Ur had a
    powerful and successful army. At one point it was the dominant force in
    Mesopotamia, establishing hegemony all the way up the Euphrates to the
    Mediterranean. Free citizens made up the higher echelons. If Abraham had
    followed a military career, he would have studied military science and
    worked up to a significant command position. Whether or not the military
    was his career, his military savvy shines in the following event.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The Campaign of Four Mesopotamian Armies</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In an astonishing military victory Abraham defeated a coalition of four
    Mesopotamian armies some nine years after he arrived in Canaan. After
    serving the King of Elam 12 years the population center where Lot moved
    rebelled. Scripture is clear about the military force that retaliated
    (Genesis 14:1-16)-its size, objective and success. The king, Chedorlaomer,
    brought his army from Elam, an area to the east of Lower Mesopotamia,
    today's southwestern Iran. These people were later called Persians. After
    Abraham followed God to Haran, Chedorlaomer's country defeated Ur and
    destroyed the city. This is well-known in secular history. In short order
    Elam extended its governance all the way to the Sodom-Gomorrah region. Now
    its present ruler came with three allies-Amraphel king of Shinar (Babylon),
    Arioch king of Ellasar (Larsa, longtime rival of Ur) and Tidal, king of
    Nations (apparently from Upper Mesopotamia).
</p>
<p>
    These four kings controlled an enormous area, from Upper Mesopotamia to
    well beyond Lower Mesopotamia, 500 to 1500 miles distant from Sodom. One
    commentator suggested this force could have numbered 100,000 soldiers.
    Their columns stretched for miles. As they left the Euphrates and marched
    southwest towards Sodom, raiders from the badlands to the east fell upon
    their columns and supply lines. Distracted from their original mission they
    began fighting people group after people group to the east of their route
    (Genesis 14:5). Eventually they fought all the way to Eilat at the head of
    the Gulf of Aqaba (Genesis 14:6).
</p>
<p>
    Turning west they encountered and defeated the desert people that occupied
    the lands south of Sodom (Genesis 14:7). Finally, they reached their
    objective, attacking the Sodomites but apparently in a surprise maneuver
    only hinted at in Scripture. The defenders expected the enemy to approach
    from the south but seem to have been pinned against the bitumen pits. This
    would point to an unexpected and unexplained backdoor route descending the
    hills to the west and only lightly guarded by the defenders. In this battle
    the consortium utterly crushed the five kings that governed the heavily
    populated Sodom-Gomorrah civilization bowl. With no opposition remaining,
    the victors began the long march home loaded with plunder and the
    population whom they would sell into slavery. Abraham's "big brother" was
    headed for a miserable future.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Abraham's Private Army</strong>
</p>
<p>
    An escapee brought the bad news to Abraham who immediately gathered his
    forces to free Lot. The odds at this point appeared to be 100 to 1. This
    was certain suicide, unless Abraham was a military genius. Scripture
    suggests as much, relating that Abraham "led forth his trained men, born in
    his house, 318 of them." (Genesis 14:14). Abraham had his own private army.
</p>
<p>
    Until now Scripture had said nothing about Abraham training his servants
    for combat. From what happens in the battle one must conclude that they had
    military skills equal to the invaders who were professional soldiers,
    battle hardened after an unexpectedly difficult possibly year-and-a-half
    long campaign. With Abraham about 84 years old the youngest of his fighters
    would have been born when Abraham was 64 years old or 11 years before he
    left Haran for Canaan. The fact that they were born in his house indicates
    he began their training at an early age and that this practice had been
    going on for many years.
</p>
<p>
    What did these trained fighters look like? As a general over his army
    Abraham trained them to handle lethal weapons and kill. His forces knew how
    to work together to overcome far superior forces. They were cunning, strong
    and had tremendous endurance. Where could Abraham possibly have gained this
    military knowledge? You guessed it-in Ur. During his early years in Ur its
    army was having great success. Now he had an army like Ur's in his very own
    household. His men could face the best from Mesopotamia. Would it be too
    much to say Abraham's 318 were among the best soldiers alive in their day?
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Abraham's Amorite Confederates</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Even more remarkable, Abraham had Amorite confederates who joined this
    suicidal venture. Why? They had to have confidence in Abraham's knowledge
    of warfare. This explains another mystery. Why would the Amorites share
    their land with Abraham in the first place? Shortly after arriving in
    Canaan the range land proved insufficient for Abraham's and Lot's cattle so
    they separated. Lot set his tent towards Sodom while Abraham moved to
    Hebron. What Scripture doesn't explain is that Hebron was the highest
    ground in Israel, even higher than Jerusalem which is a half mile above sea
    level. It was one of the most out of the way and defensible locations
    Abraham could choose. Furthermore, it had limited access. It was at a dead
    end. Abraham literally took the high ground. But it was occupied by
    Amorites. So while this act displays great military savvy, how would the
    Amorites ever be persuaded to share their land with him?
</p>
<p>
    First, Abraham proved to be a diplomat and a business man. Somehow, he
    showed them that his presence would be to their advantage. Second, he must
    have shared his military experiences from Ur. The Amorites had never heard
    such things. They were impressed. His fighters and the Amorite fighters
    would have contests. Abraham's were superior. Abraham began telling them
    how he trained his fighters. They formed a mutual defense alliance. Over a
    five or six year period the Amorites greatly increased their military
    skills and came to have unflagging confidence in Abraham.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <strong>A Military Victory for the Books</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now Lot and his family were prisoners. Abraham loved his nephew and saw his
    interest in the true God ("righteous Lot" II Peter 2:7). But what chance
    did Abraham have against the ocean of invaders? Again, his knowledge of
    warfare. He would know that once the invader's campaign was successful, the
    kings and most of their soldiers would head for home at top speed. At a
    much slower pace a small but adequate force would return with the vast
    plunder and the many slaves. Possibly only 5,000 to 10,000 soldiers
    remained, but still the odds were five or ten to one.
</p>
<p>
    But Abraham had one more ace up his sleeve. He knew that discipline would
    be almost non-existent now that the army had vanquished all opposition. The
    coalition had been fighting for over a year. This was a time to celebrate
    and those celebrations typically came in the form of nightly drunken orgies
    at the expense of the female prisoners. Apparently even nighttime
    reconnaissance patrols were neglected. From his days in Ur Abraham
    understood the various plans for night watches, passwords, trumpet signals,
    command structure, and camp layout. He also knew the typical contingency
    plans for night attacks. In other words, he knew the military science of
    Southern Mesopotamia. Further, he and senior members of his household knew
    the various languages of Mesopotamia and could use those languages to get
    inside the enemy's defenses. Further yet, he had grazed his flocks for
    years through the entire area and knew every trail like the back of his
    hand. Undoubtedly he sent scouts ahead to gather intelligence. Here in
    abbreviated fashion is the scriptural account:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        And he divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants,
        and defeated them and pursued them to Hobah, north of Damascus. Genesis
        14:15.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Abraham's plan was to strike in a night attack from multiple directions.
    This plan employed a major strategy of military science-surprise. But it
    also violated two principles-attacking at night and dividing one's force
    against a superior force. It was very, very risky. There would be either
    great reward or great loss. Abraham was the overall commander with three
    Amorite bands taking orders from him. Possibly his force numbered 600-700.
    Abraham and senior officers had to have gone over the plan in great detail.
    They caught up with the invaders where the city of Dan would later be
    established on the northern boundary of Israel about 110 air miles north of
    Hebron. The forced march could hardly have been accomplished in four
    exhausting days. Along the way they encountered injured and dead prisoners
    and a trail of their discarded possessions. By the time they reached Dan,
    though exhausted, they were highly motivated.
</p>
<p>
    Abraham's night attack was a complete success. He could have found wounded
    or dead soldiers along the way and taken their uniforms to dress some of
    his troops to infiltrate their lines. Perhaps he impersonated a commander
    of the invaders and gave guards contradictory orders, using his mastery of
    the languages of Lower Mesopotamia and his intimate knowledge of their
    military operations. Whatever strategy he used, he utterly surprised and
    routed the invaders. He drove the fleeing confederation fifty miles, to a
    place called Hobah somewhere north of Damascus. He knew that if the army
    regrouped and counterattacked it would all be over for him and his allies.
    No enemy soldier could be spared; it was either complete victory or
    eventual disaster. Even one escapee could provide the information needed
    for a retaliatory strike the next year.

    has Col. R. B. Thieme Jr. to thank for many of the above insights. Col.
    Thieme's military genius was followed by international Bible teaching from
    studying the original languages of Scripture. Thieme served his country in
    World War II, becoming the youngest man ever, up to that point, to make
    full colonel in the US Army. After the war he graduated from Dallas
    Theological Seminary in 1950 (Th.M.) with the intention of entering the DTS
    Hebrew doctoral program in the Fall. That summer found him as the interim
    pulpit supply at Berachah Church in Houston Texas where he was made pastor
    and served that church until 2004, maintaining a unique schedule of seven
    hours of Bible teaching at his church weekly. Tapes of those studies
    circled the globe.

<p>
    <strong>Abraham's Best Defense</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The next spring when armies go to war found Abraham knotted up in fear.
    This would be the time when the Mesopotamians would return to wreak
    vengeance on him and his neighbors. Where does this idea come from? The
    very next chapter records how God appeared to him in a vision and said,
    "Fear not, Abram. I am your shield; your reward shall be very great."
    (Genesis 15:1). Abraham had dared to strike the flower of Mesopotamia. Now
    he feared the worst. But he did not have to fear because the God of
    creation would be his shield. Further, apparently he was having second
    thoughts about having lifted up his hand "to the LORD God Most High,
    Possessor [Creator] of heaven and earth, &#8230;not to take a thread or a
    sandal strap or anything that [belonged to Sodom] lest [the king of Sodom]
    should say, 'I have made Abram rich'" Genesis 14:22-23. Had that been the
    right thing to do? Yes, because for that stand God promised that his reward
    would be <strong>very</strong> great.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>75 Years of Preparation in Ur and Haran </strong>
    (see also Appendix 3.4)<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Abraham's military skills point to many adult years in Ur, not the sleepy
    village of Urfa 25 miles northwest of Haran while his altars point to years
    of growing closer to the LORD in Haran. During the Haran years Terah's
    influence waned while Abraham's influence grew. The vast numbers of
    Abraham's cattle when he separated from Lot and the 318 shepherd/warriors
    born in his house indicate that Abraham did not separate from his father's
    household but rather influenced his father's household to worship the God
    who led him to Canaan.
</p>
<p>
    Genesis 14 provides a remarkable fit of Scripture and secular history with
    regard to Abraham's early years. It records that the Sodom-Gomorrah
    confederation had paid tribute to the king of Elam for 12 years. When they
    did not pay in the 13<sup>th</sup>, the war machine from Mesopotamia came
    to teach them a lesson in the 14<sup>th</sup> year led by Elam. The
    campaign apparently lasted the better part of two years. Secular history
    records that Ur reached its zenith during the 97 golden-year rule of the
    five kings of the Third Dynasty. It is an historical fact that its end came
    suddenly at the hands of Elam. Elam broke Ur's control of the lower
    Euphrates in a military invasion that overwhelmed the capital itself,
    burned its palace and enslaved its population. In a strange and as yet not
    understood alliance with other Mesopotamian powers only specifically
    reported in Scripture to date, Elam extended its control all the way to
    Sodom and Gomorrah. Had Abraham not left Ur in obedience to God, he would
    have lost his freedom and wealth if not his life.
</p>
<p>
    The timeline looks like this: Scripture clearly indicates the passing of 14
    years, from the first year in which the pentapolis paid tribute to Elam
until Elam and its allies arrived to punish them for not paying in the 13    <sup>th</sup>. The time needed to forge alliances and establish control
    from Ur up the Euphrates and then down the Jordan Valley to the five cities
    is unknown. This could have been accomplished in as little as a year or
    two. Thus, an estimated minimum of 16 years passed from the fall of Ur to
    the punishment dealt the five cities.
</p>
<p>
    Sometime before the fall of Ur, God called Abraham. Upon responding to the
    call, he lived an unknown number of years in Haran. Then God led him from
    Haran to Canaan and when Elam arrived to punish the rebels Abraham had been
    in Canaan approximately nine years. This is known because of the next
    sequence of events in Abraham's life: God's appearance in a vision and the
    blood covenant the next spring, the birth of Ishmael a year later and the
    birth of Isaac when Abraham was 100 and Ishmael was 14. Since Abraham was
    75 when he arrived in Canaan, he would be 84 when the invaders defeated
    Sodom and enslaved Lot.
</p>
<p>
    Secular history gives various ranges of dates for the glorious years of the
    Third Dynasty of Ur. The ancient cuneiform documents are consistent in
    their records of the names of the five kings of the Third Dynasty, the
    number of years each reigned and the major achievements of each. It was the
    second of five that actually raised Ur to dominance. However, secular
    history has been unable to anchor their 97-year total reign to a fixed
    time. Instead, it offers various ranges of dates, from early, to moderate,
    to late, etc. They differ by as much as at total of 155 years. The earliest
    range ends at 2150 BC and the latest ends at 1995 BC. Abraham was 75 at
    2091 so he fits well into the secular range of dates.
</p>
<p>
    Two entire chapters of the Bible come out of Elam's rise (Genesis 14 and
    15). Is that enough to set us thinking that maybe Abraham was an important
    figure in Ur? Could it be that at the time of God's call, Abraham was well
    into the politics or military of Ur and did not like the way negotiations
    were going between his country and Elam? Could it be that due to the
    growing problems facing Ur's leaders, he was not so certain about Ur's
    future after all? Could it be that when God called, for the first time in
    his life he might actually consider leaving Ur? We can only wonder but we
    do know that God's timing is perfect.
</p>
<p>
    Here is another thought to chew on: Elam's having conquered the Jordan
    Valley just years before Abraham arrived in Canaan would explain why he
    could move about so freely. The long established powers of the land had
    been shaken to their roots and were busy recovering and rebuilding after
    Elam swept through so they paid little attention to this man and his many
    flocks and shepherds. This also vouches for our dates.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, in an entirely different vein, Elam only dominated Southern
    Mesopotamia for a short time. Then in some as yet unexplained way the
    alliance or one of its members turned on Elam and its power was broken in
    that region until the rise of the Persian Empire 1500 years later. A
    215-year sojourn in Egypt would place the birth of Abraham long after
    Elam's dominance in Mesopotamia and Sodom. If that were the case, Genesis
    14 would be fiction. Further, rivals of Ur governed that city-state once
    Elam's control had been broken. So whether it was Elam or Ur's rivals, such
    a time would not have been conducive to Terah and his relatives thriving in
    Ur. If his kinsmen survived at all, it would have been because they fled
    the country. If they returned, they would have been involved in picking up
    the pieces and living under the control of various other powers and that is
    not how secular sources picture the Ur of Abraham's day.

    <strong>Scriptural Support that Abraham's Call Came in Ur</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We are convinced that God's call came to Abraham in Ur, not Haran, and that
    he spent a number of years in Haran before God led him the rest of the way
    to Canaan. But hyper literalists who bend all Scripture to the numbers in
    Shem's genealogy reject this position. To support their 215-year Egyptian
    sojourn view, they interpret the Apostle Paul's words in Galatians 3 to
    mean that God called Abraham in Haran, not Ur and that he immediately
    followed God to Canaan. Then 430-years later God gave Israel the Law on
    Mount Sinai immediately following the Exodus. They interpret the details of
    Abraham's life to fit this view. Book after book repeats this idea. The
    Apostle is their only hope even though they misinterpret his argument. When
    they deal with the four witnesses of chapter 2, they always start with
    Paul.
</p>
<p>
    Nevertheless, what saith the LORD? In the first half of this chapter we
    showed that such a view is ruled out by the events in Abraham's life. The
    rest of the chapter will look at specific statements of Scripture. The
    information will be organized around eight Old Testament passages, one New
    Testament passage and an argument from silence. These ten arguments show
    beyond question the error of a Haran call and the 215-year sojourn behind
    it.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Stephen Says "Ur"</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In the days following the resurrection of Christ, Stephen was full of grace
    and power, doing great wonders and signs among the people. Those who
disputed with him could not withstand the wisdom and the    <strong><u>Spirit</u></strong> with which he spoke, so they found people
    who falsely charged that Stephen spoke blasphemous words against Moses and
    God (Acts 6:8-11). This caused a disturbance that landed Stephen before the
    council where additional false charges were made. Stephen defended himself
    by reciting major events in the history of Israel, especially showing how
    the nation had established a pattern of rejecting God's messengers, last of
    all, the Messiah. Speaking by the Holy Spirit, he began with Jewish history
    that none could deny:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father
Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,        <sup>3</sup>and said to him, "Go out from your land and from your
        kindred and go into the land which I will show you." <sup>4</sup>Then
        he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And
        after his father died, God removed him from there into this land. Acts
        7:2-4.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Stephen said exactly what this book maintains are the facts and which those
    who add only numbers deny. His words are clear. They can't be interpreted
    to mean something else. So, in this case the numerologists don't deny or
    put a spin on what he said. Rather they say he made a slip of the tongue;
    what he said was erroneous. They say that inerrancy only guarantees that
    Stephen said these words, not that he had his facts straight. They say
    maybe he was under pressure and was rattled or maybe he was a young
    believer and didn't have a good grasp of the Old Testament. Somehow,
    Stephen misstated. Their numbers supplant words.
</p>
<p>
    It is true that inerrancy assures us of what someone said, even when they
    speak error. For instance, God had told Adam he would die if he ate fruit
    from a certain tree. Then the serpent said to Eve that she would not die if
    she ate from that tree (Genesis 3:4). Scripture accurately reported that
    the serpent said this even though what he said was untrue.
</p>
<p>
    This interpretative tool is useful, but used wrongly is dangerous. It can
    be used against any of the people in Scripture that said something the
    critic disagrees with. There must be strong evidence that the speaker spoke
    in error. Where is this evidence? Their only evidence is that it conflicts
    with their interpretation of what Paul said in Galatians three. So they say
    Paul was right; Stephen was wrong. We suggest both Stephen and Paul were
    right. When Paul's words are correctly understood, his words will agree
    completely with the words of Stephen. Invoking this extra ordinary use of
    the principle of inerrancy is incredulous, strained. After all, Stephen was
    full of the Holy Spirit:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>5</sup>
        Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit. <sup>8</sup>
        Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs
        among the people. <sup>10</sup>They could not withstand the wisdom and
        the Spirit with which he was speaking. Acts 6:5, 8, 10.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Recognizing that Stephen did speak accurately, others find a different
    interpretation of Acts 7:4 in order to maintain Abraham was the firstborn
    of Terah's sons. They observe that three personalities are found in verses
    2-4: God, Terah and Abraham. While verse four speaks of "his father," it
    uses the personal pronoun four times. They say "he removed him" refers to
    Abraham removing his father Terah, not God removing Abraham. So rather than
    God leading Abraham on to Canaan after Terah died, this view says that
    sixty years after Abraham arrived in Canaan, his father died. Abraham then
    returned to Haran and brought his father's body to Canaan for burial. They
    emphasize that this is consistent with the Hebrew mindset of the importance
    of where one was buried and are adamant about this interpretation.
</p>
<p>
    Such an explanation is strained and unnecessary. Why would Stephen begin
    his address with where Abraham's father was buried rather than that God
    Himself led the founder of the Jewish race to Canaan? This bad explanation
    demonstrates just how far the numbers over words folks will go to uphold
    their chronology from Shem to Abraham. They seem to suffer from
    over-literalism. This chapter previously showed another example of
    over-literalism. When Scripture says that at the age of 70 Terah fathered
    three sons, Abraham, Nahor and Haran, it was not implying that they were
    triplets or that this was their birth order. Rather, Scripture was naming
    them in the order of their importance. Abraham was the youngest, not the
    oldest.
</p>
<p>
    Now for the eight Old Testament passages that indicate the call came in Ur.
    Many times a single statement in the Bible is used to establish a biblical
    truth. Two or three witnesses established a truth in a Jewish court of law.
    Including the silence of Scripture, we find ten to establish that Ur was
    the country God called Abraham to leave.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Eight Old Testament Scriptures Argue for "Ur"</strong>
</p>
<p>
    1.<strong> Genesis 15:7.</strong> God Himself said He brought Abraham out
    from Ur. If the call had come in Haran, God would have said "I am the LORD
    who brought you out of Haran."<strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        And he said to him, "I am the LORD who brought you out from Ur of the
        Chaldeans to give you this land to possess." Genesis 15:7.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    2. <strong>Genesis 12:1.</strong> In the call God told Abraham to separate
    from his father's household. That would make sense if the call came in Ur
    because his father had compromised with the idolatry of that city and God
    wanted to get Abraham away from his father's influence. But if the call
    came in Haran after his father died, there would be no father with his
    idolatry to separate from. Death would have done the job. Further, by the
    time his father died, his father's household had turned from the idolatry
    of Ur and was worshiping at Abraham's altar in Haran. In the end Abraham
    and Lot inherited Terah's household.
</p>
<p>
    3. <strong>Genesis 11:31. </strong>At God's prompting the journey began in
    Ur, not Haran.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        Terah took Abram [Abraham] his son and Lot the son of Haran, his
        grandson, and Sarai [Sarah] his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife,
        and they went forth together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go into the
        land of Canaan, but when they came to Haran, they settled there.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    This verse was written in retrospect. It clearly says they departed from
    Ur, not Haran, to go to Canaan. While Terah was the patriarch and therefore
    nominally in charge, his son Abraham was determined to obey God and go to a
    land God would show him, so in effect, Terah was accompanying his son, not
    leading his son.
</p>
<p>
    4. <strong>Genesis 11:28</strong> says that "Haran [Terah's oldest son]
    died in the presence of his father Terah in the land of his kindred, in Ur
    of the Chaldeans." Terah's kindred which we would call relatives lived in
    Ur, not Haran. Since one of the conditions of God's call to Abraham was to
    leave his kindred, the call must have come where Abraham's kindred
    lived-Ur.
</p>
<p>
    5. <strong>Genesis 11:27-25:11.</strong> Argument from the organization of
    Genesis. The 215-year view notes that the death of Terah is recorded in
    Genesis 11 while the call is recorded in Genesis 12. They conclude that the
    call was issued after Terah's death. When they read "Now the LORD said to
    Abram&#8230;," they understand it to be saying, "<strong>Then</strong> the
    LORD said to Abram&#8230;" Genesis 12:1. But, are these events sequential?
    Does the fact that the record of the call follows the notice of Terah's
    death prove God issued the call after Terah's death? Not at all.
</p>
<p>
    Genesis arranges biographical material in logical groupings. First one life
    or episode is stated, then another life or episode is presented. Terah's
    life is presented in Genesis 11:27-32. Abraham's life follows in Genesis
    12-25:11. This is followed by Ishmael's in Genesis 25:12-18, Isaac's in
    Genesis 25:19-26:35, Jacob's in 27-35, Esau's in 36, then Joseph's and so
    on. What could be more important in the Abraham section than his call?
    Thus, the Abraham chapters begin with his call. The fact that Abraham's
    call is recorded following the end of the section on Terah says nothing
    about when it was issued.
</p>
<p>
    6. <strong>Nehemiah 9:7-8. </strong>Other Old Testament books refer to
    Abraham's country as Ur, not Haran. Abraham was told to leave his country.
    Since his country was Ur, the call came when he was living there.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>7</sup>
        You are the LORD, the God who chose Abram and brought him out of Ur of
        the Chaldeans and gave him the name Abraham. <sup>8</sup>You found his
        heart faithful before you and made with him the covenant to give to his
        offspring the land of the Canaanite&#8230;.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Nehemiah ranks high among pious Old Testament Jews in prominent places. He
    mourned and wept with fasting and prayers for days when he heard that the
    walls of Jerusalem had not been repaired. Then when he was performing his
    task of setting wine before the emperor of the Persian Empire, Artaxerxes,
    the king noticed his sadness. The story came out and Nehemiah was allowed
    to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the walls. He organized those who had
    returned to Jerusalem and in the face of much opposition, the walls were
    rebuilt in just 52 days. Following this was a time of intense spiritual
    renewal. He records the Levites praying the words quoted above. They
    acknowledged that God had brought Abraham out of Ur of the Chaldeans. For
    fifteen hundred years the descendants of Abraham had understood that God
    first called Abraham in Ur and later in Canaan made a covenant with him to
    give his descendants that land. God's bringing was from Ur, not from Haran.
</p>
<p>
    7-8. <strong>Joshua 24:2-3. </strong>Two arguments come from these and
    other verses:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        <sup>2</sup>
        Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, "Long ago your fathers lived
        beyond the Euphrates, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor, and
        they served other gods. <sup>3</sup>Then I took your father Abraham
        from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and
        made his offspring many&#8230;" Joshua 24:2-3.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    Joshua specifically states that the fathers of Israel, Terah, Abraham and
    Nahor, practiced idolatry ("served other gods") before God took Abraham
    from where they lived "beyond the Euphrates" to Canaan. Their idolatry was
    real. They did this in Ur. God broke Abraham's idolatrous ways by
    separating him from the powerful idolatrous culture of Ur. In Haran Abraham
    established the worship of the true God in Terah's household. This worship
    continued during the lifetime of Isaac and was the faith Jacob was raised
    in. On the other hand, Nahor followed Terah and Abraham to the general area
    around Haran but kept his idols. His grandson still held to them when Jacob
    came to live with him. Abraham's break with idolatry began when he moved
    from Ur, not from Haran. Therefore, the call came in Ur, not Haran.
</p>
<p>
    Joshua's use of the phrase "beyond the Euphrates" also points to the call
    coming in Ur, not Haran. Altogether this phrase or similar words occur a
    dozen times more in Ezra and Nehemiah. The Euphrates is 1000 miles long. It
    begins near the mountains of Armenia, flows somewhat west, curves south and
    finally heads southeast to empty into the Persian Gulf. Haran is across the
    Euphrates River but the expression is mostly used for more than simply
    crossing the river. It is like a sweep of the hand to indicate a great
    distance. In most of its occurrences this phrase refers to Lower
    Mesopotamia. Thus, it also confirms that the call came in Ur.
</p>
<p>
    9. While Scripture specifically says the call came in Ur as seen in the
    many references above, nowhere in the Old or New Testaments does it say or
    even hint that the call came in Haran. Arguments from silence in themselves
    do not establish a truth of Scripture. But when combined with positive
    declarative statements, they do add validity to the concept under
    consideration.
</p>
<p>
    In summary, the conditions of Abraham's call, to leave country, kindred,
    family and go to a land God would show him could only apply to the time
    when Abraham lived in Ur. Why is that so important? Abraham had to replace
    the idolatry that gripped Ur with faith in the one true God. Was he ready
    for that? He was ready to leave his kindred and Ur, but leaving his
    father's household was a road block. Refusing to stay behind they also
    would need to leave their idol worship and that was not easily done. So
    Haran became an important first step. It cannot be dismissed which the call
    coming in Haran does. Hebrews 11 makes it clear that by faith Abraham
    obeyed, going out to an unknown destination but ultimately expecting a city
    with better foundations, one whose builder and maker is God. Exactly what
    he left is very important: the world with all its idols, wealth and glamor.
    That was Ur, not Haran.
